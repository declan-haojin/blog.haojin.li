Hey there! My name is Haojin and I am currently an undergraduate student studying Computer Science and (hopefully) Political Science at [Duke University](https://duke.edu). This blog was originally created to document my competitive programming journey back in high school, but it has since evolved into a space where I can blog about anything that interests me. My blog is structured around three main themes that encompass different aspects of my life: [learning](/categories), [adventure](/categories), and [reflection](/categories).


## üá®üá≥ Hometown

Xi'an, China where [Terra Cotta Soldiers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terracotta_Army) is located.

- A dedicated fan of Microsoft who has spontaneously visited their many offices worldwide including their headquarters in Redmond.
- After a strenuous [6-hour hike](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/virginia/old-rag-mountain-loop-trail) in Virginia, I committed to pursuing one of my life-long dreams: thru-hiking the [Appalachian Trail](https://appalachiantrail.org/explore/hike-the-a-t/thru-hiking/).
- But before that, I also want to visit all National Parks in the US.
