I think it's time for me to begin my application. These days my mother is trying to find professional counselors who can be helpful in the course of my application. Also, I know the most important thing is myself. I need to be prepared first and make choice finally. So that's the reason why I am doing this, looking for useful information from several college websites. Here is the first one, that many peers including I admire the most: Stanford University.

*I will mark and reorganize some points mentioned in the intro which I think is useful.*

# Holistic Admission

---

> One piece tells us about your background and life experiences, another about your school and your academic achievement. We learn from others about your character and intellectual contributions. In your essays, we learn about your ideas and interests, and what is meaningful to you.
>
> In a holistic review, we seek to understand how you, as a whole person, would grow, contribute, and thrive at Stanford, and how Stanford would, in turn, be changed by you.

## Academic Excellence

> The most important credential for evaluating your academic record is your high school transcript.

## Intellectual Vitality

> We want to see the kind of curiosity and enthusiasm that will allow you to spark a lively discussion in a freshman seminar and continue the conversation at a dinner table.

- anything on Microsoft and other tech company, their product, services and strategy.
-  Technology that I can take advantage of and creating something real and helpful.
  - Cloud which helps me build websites, spreading information and thinking.

> We want to see the initiative with which you seek out opportunities and expand your perspective.

- Be the man with one-row light in the early morning every school day.

## Extracurricular Activities

> In fact, an exceptional depth of experience in one or two activities may demonstrate your passion more than minimal participation in five or six clubs.

> In general, we want to understand the impact you have had at your job, in your family, in a club, in your school, or in the larger community, and we want to learn of the impact that experience has had on you.

> By focusing on your achievements in context, we evaluate how you have excelled in your school environment and how you have taken advantage of what is available to you in your school and community.

# Application and Essays

---

## Common Application Essat Prompts

> Choose one of the following prompts for your personal essay. The Common App sets a 250-word minimum and a 650-word maximum.
>
> - Some students have a background, identity, interest or talent that is so meaningful they believe their application would be incomplete without it. If this sounds like you, then please share your story.
> - The lessons we take from *obstacles we encounter* can be fundamental to later success. Recount a time when you faced a *challenge, setback, or failure*. How did it affect you, and what did you learn from the experience?
> - Reflect on a time when you *questioned* or challenged a belief or idea. What prompted your *thinking*? What *was the outcome*?
> - Describe a problem you've solved or a problem you'd like to solve. It can be an intellectual challenge, a research query, an ethical dilemma—anything that is of personal importance, no matter the scale. Explain its significance to you and what steps you took or could be taken to identify a solution.
> - Discuss an accomplishment, event, or realization that *sparked a period of personal growth and a new understanding of yourself or others*.
> - Describe a topic, idea, or concept you find so engaging that it makes you lose all track of time. Why does it captivate you? What or who do you turn to when you want to learn more?
> - Share an essay on any topic of your choice. It can be one you've already written, one that responds to a different prompt, or one of your own design.

## Stanford Short Essay Questions

> We ask applicants to write a short essay on each of the following three topics. There is a 100-word minimum and a 250-word maximum for each essay.
>
> 1. The Stanford community is deeply curious and driven to learn in and out of the classroom. Reflect on an idea or experience that makes you genuinely excited about learning.
> 2. Virtually all of Stanford's undergraduates live on campus. Write a note to your future roommate that reveals something about you or that will help your roommate—and us—get to know you better.
> 3. Tell us about something that is meaningful to you, and why?
