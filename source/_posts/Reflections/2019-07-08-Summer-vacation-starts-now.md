## A colorful semester has gone

A lot of words I want to say… This period of time I studied and lived in International Course Campus really impressed me. I never imagined that I would met a group of people who are talented and friendly in my freshman. When I first came here, I was very enlightend but of course with a little nervous. However, the enthusiasm of students and teachers made me energetic and full of hope towards the future.

### Super massive activities

There were many meaningful and unforgettable events and activities have been held this semester. Not only broadening my horizon but also building a bridge between the guys who have the same dream and interest with me.

I firstly picked up `VEX Robotics competition` which I had learned and fell in love with before. The same program but different people. I met Jessica, a very talented girl in our team, who is good at writing building log and the most important I think is that she treats everthing careful and make 100% efforts in. She is an example for me and there are many things I can learn from her.

What’s more, I participated in `NSDA debate`. To be honest, it was my first time to express my own views about a social problem detaily in the face of others, even in English. It was a big challenge but I also learned a lot from it. I will never forget the moment that we beat the opponents ranking the first place temporarily.

Also, taking part in many `Discipline Competition` such as Math, Chemistry. For instance, In the preparation of the ARML, I came into contact with the Team Match which is brand new for me. I really enjoyed the process that thinking and dicussing with others together including relay rounds.

### graduation ceremony

The last event that I had in my freshman is the `graduation ceremony`. ( I mean graduated from senior I to senior II) There was a video edited by my classmates reviewing the whole years about our class. Although I came here later instead at the very beginning, I was moved by it. I am glad and pleasured to be a member of Foundation III. Maybe we will not be appered as a unity once more, but we were once a unity. It’s enough for us to keep in touch with each other and perish the friendship forever.

## A unpredictable vacation starts now

### I need a plan about my valuable vacation

There is no doubt that I will have my first `TOEFL` test this vacation, and also I need to work hard to reach the highest score as possible as I can.
