# Why do I write the blog?

I was using `Microsoft Edge` since I am a one hundred percent fan of Microsoft, also because I believe that the original one is the best one just like original desktop wallpaper, original antivirus software and so on. However, I have changed to `Google Chrome Browser` a few month ago. I realized that `Chrome` is truly worthy of the name. A multitude of wide-ranging extension, highly personalized costume and super fast response speed are the reason that I love this browser so much. 

When I explore the `Google Extension Shop`, I found many interesting and perfect extensions. After my trying and  experiencing, I got a list of the best extension recommended personally. Hope the following extensions would be helpful for you. **Feel free to ask any kind of questions in the comment zone at the bottom of the blog!**
