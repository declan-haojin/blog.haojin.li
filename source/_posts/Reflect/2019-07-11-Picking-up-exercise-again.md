## Glad to meet you again

> **It’s been a long day without you**, my friend
> And I’ll tell you all about it when I see you again
> We’ve come a long way from where we began
> Oh, I’ll tell you all about it when I see you again
> When I see you again

## My motivation

Believe it or not, my motivation to pick up taking exercise is a Bluetooth earphone, **Galaxy Buds** which was introduced by ,my dormmate Dexter. I had experienced his new Galaxy Buds for a week long because his phone was confiscated by the dormitory administrator. It’s a little wired,right?

As I first used his earphone, I was impressed by its amazing sound effect and comfortable wearing. After that, I decided to buy one telling my parents that I want a new earphone for practicing my TOEFL Listening skill more conveniently and effectively. Thanks for my great mom, she agreed me to buy one without hesitation.

## Try again

Today, my new earphone finally was received on the morning. Therefore, I would like to try it at once so I went to gym with my father who takes exercises everyday, definitely a resemble for me. I have no idea that when I was running on the treadmill, some emotions come to my mind. Feeling like being accepted by Harvard, I kept jogging for 30 minutes at a relatively high speed.

**After the exercise, my sports T-shirt has been soaked in sweat. I even can’t walk down the stairs well with some pain in my leg muscles.**

## I want to keep doing it

Although I was so tired, without doubt it’s a good way to **vent pressure**. I would like to keep it becoming a habit, which will be good for both my physics and mental health.
