# A moving film -- Rudy

## Today I cried

I have never imagined that I can be moved so deeply by a particular film. From my childhood, I have watched plenty of films including comedy, science friction, actin, plot… but none of them could make me cry. I even usually laugh at my mother crying while watching some TV series and reality show. However, now , it’s time for me to change my mind. I would like to introduce this film to you, a fantastic one that makes cold me cry.

## Introduction

The film I want talk about is called [*Rudy*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudy_(film)), which is a famous biographical sports film directed by David Anspaugh. The film is an account of life of Daniel “Rudy” Ruettiger who has been fighting for his football dream by all efforts despite significant obstacle.

## Watching by chance

I’m not myself today because of something that even I didn’t know. I simply searched on YouTube to find some introductions and recommendations about some inspirational films. Fortunately, the first text come into view is of course this film *Rudy*. Therefore, I downloaded it at once watching it.

## Something really touch me

I am not going to spoil anything, just a few plots that really impressed me.

### On his best friend’s funeral

He was despair and depress when the song begun. Rushing out of the church to cry and cry, to my surprise, he decided to go to Notre Dame University which he appreciated since his birth but nobody believed him could have done that. With no hesitate, no excess grief, he take the bus directly in the cold night.

### Standing on the changing room reading the text graved on the wall

After he was allowed to take a job in charge of logistics of football team, he went to work. Once he got there, he looked at the text graved on the wall like a Saint reading the text devoutly. I can see the passion and dream from his words and eyes.

### Everyone in the gym cheering for Rudy

After the friend in Rudy’s team first called his name, the voice spreading across the whole gym with everyone no matter if recognized Rudy beginning to cheer for Rudy including his old friends, teammates, family…

## My personal feeling

I believed that a good film doesn’t require something spectacular or amazing, just a normal one with an unusual dream like the film. From some extent, Rudy is me, I am Rudy. I see myself on him. I cheer for myself, for my dream.

At last, some inspiring line for myself:

> - Having dreams is what makes life tolerable
> - In this life you don’t have to prove nothing to nobody except yourself. And after what you’ve done through, if you haven’t done by now, it ain’t gonna never happen. And I guarantee a week won’t go by, you won’t regret walking out letting them get the best of you.
> - My whole life, people have been telling me what I could do and couldn’t do. I’ve always listened to them, believed in what they said. I don’t want to do that anymore.
