    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It’s again been a long time since I wrote the last post.</p><span id="more"></span><p>I used to skip blogging because I don’t have a lot things to write during that period of time. However, there are too much these days that I even could not fully experience let alone recording them in written.</p><h2 id="Pre-Code"><a href="#Pre-Code" class="headerlink" title="Pre-Code+"></a>Pre-Code+</h2><p>After coming back from the beach week, I moved to friends’ apartment near west campus. It is the first time ever I lived someplace truly independent. Campus dorm doesn’t count since I could get everything I want within walking distance. Also there are staffs taking care of all housekeeping and tedious logistics things for you.</p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20220619174125.png" alt="View from the floor of the livng room"></p><p>It was nice staying in an independent place, though sleeping on the floor in the living room. I slept unexpectedly really well every night and developed some good habits that I should have had a long time ago. I took a shower every morning to wake myself which I normally did at night since I could not get up in the morning. I continued to cook food for myself but more frequently. I started to practice LeetCode problems every day with friends on Zoom. I kept working in Perkins OIT desk to earn some pocket money.</p><p>In a nutshell, this is the first ever summer I felt like I am being productive instead of doing nothing.</p><h2 id="Code"><a href="#Code" class="headerlink" title="Code+"></a>Code+</h2><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20220619174004.png" alt="Moving back to campus"></p><p>It’s Code+ time. To be honest, I have a lot of expectations toward the program. I got kind of disappointed in the first week of Code+ since we attended quite a few extremely entry-level programming classes and useless lectures. Then I started to learn everything we need for our project by myself. It turned out really well.</p><p>Also supporting staffs of the program are really helpful who I learned a lot from. It feels exciting to build an actual website that could help Duke students. I have to say that I enjoy working every day 9 to 5 and debugging all tricky problems I encountered. That sense of achievement has made me convinced and determined to be a software engineer at least in the near future.</p><p>Some fellow participants said I was really smart and the prototype I built was really awesome. But I do believe there’s nothing difficult of what I achieved. I just put all my efforts and I am genuinely interested in software development. It’s nothing like algorithm design or academic researches that I believe require high understanding of knowledge and IQ. Nevertheless, it is an important work that makes differences to people’s life. It is a miniature of amazing high technologies that human has developed. This is exactly what I would love to do. I am delighted that Code+ not only “forces” me to learn skills myself but also makes me confident and determined in software development.</p><h2 id="Cooking"><a href="#Cooking" class="headerlink" title="Cooking"></a>Cooking</h2><h2 id="Hang-out"><a href="#Hang-out" class="headerlink" title="Hang out"></a>Hang out</h2><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20220619174304.png" alt="Eno River Quarry: jumping into a lake first ever in my life"></p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20220619174417.png" alt="2022 Commencement: It was freezing cold and I was wearing a single shirt"></p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20220630220224.png" alt="Cooking for my friends!!!"></p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20220630220258.png" alt="Beach is my dream"></p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20220630220415.png" alt="Falls Lake (I should have jumped into the lake again)"></p><p><em>There are just too much to share about my life… :)</em></p><p>Best,<br>Haojin</p>]]></content>

    <title>The End of My Freshman Year</title>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Standing at the myrtle beach today, I began to reflect on my Freshman journey. </p><span id="more"></span><p>I feel very blessed and fortuated enough to have what I have seen, experienced, and learned from this school year. I never thought my first year in college would be as good as it went through. I was questioning about fate and believed everything is in my control if I worked hard enough. It is just not the truth after experiencing and contemplating on all the things that happened to me. </p><p>I am grateful for my fate. I only had in total a month of online school classes since the covid began. When the virus hitting US, I had come back to normal school mood back in China. As now the virus explodes in China, I have come to US for studying. I still hate Zoom and cannot imagine how my friends went through even all-year-long online courses. I feel like everything in my life is finely presetted so I could have the best outcome as possible. In this sense, I believe myself as a special person as I am certainly being blessed by someone or something that I do not think others have in the same way as I have.</p><p>I am grateful for people around me. I know I have already said this over and over again, but I do genuienly feel this way. Opporuntities, happinesses and thoughts I have, those are all brought by someone else than me. I have met so many talented, passionate, unique and interesting people at Duke that makes me feel previliged to talk to them. I woudld like to list them all but I could not since the list would be super long. It is amazing that how many people have helped me and together shaped me into the person I am today.</p><p>Looking back at the entire school year, there are also countless highlight moments for me. A random dinner with friends, a road-trip, a makenew Friday, whatsoever… But it never is how I grinded out an exam or what is my quiz score on certain tests. I believe, at least for me, grades is the least important thing among all those important things. As long as I have no regrets to myself, I do not think I should put more time on grades. But also, classes are more important than grades as I always tried to do an interesting but harder question rather than easy but boring one. I did that on my phiolosophy final and I felt so good about it that I do not care about the grade anymore as I have spoken what I would like to say and to learn what I want to learn.</p><p>The life is full of adventures ahead waiting for me. Life is fantastic and just best of the best. I kind of understand why 生命 and 生活 are both life in English—因为我像爱生命一样爱我的生活，爱生活一样爱着我的生命。</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Well the true March Madness we lost. But we are the final four!</p><span id="more"></span><p>I never enjoyed watching a basketball game but this time. The game was so tight and intense. Alright, I still don’t like basketball at all. The March Madness is my March Madness.</p><h2 id="APO"><a href="#APO" class="headerlink" title="APO"></a>APO</h2><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20220410000218.png" alt="Help cleanning in an addiction treatment house"></p><p>It is a fraternity but it is not. I never intend to join a frat but intend to join an organization where I could do good deeds usually. So I guess this is a perfect choice for me. When the first time I participated APO event, people here were chilled and there was a vibe of chilling in general which I enjoyed a lot. </p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20220409233840.png" alt="Help packing food for people in need"></p><p>it turned out not bad. I would not say I made a few best friends here but I did meet a lot of good people. I enjoy talking with them and doing silly things in the so-called brotherhood week.</p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20220409233737.png" alt="Duke Forest Highway Cleanup: I learned a lot of American beer brands"></p><p>I wish I could be more involved in the group but also I am chilled with everything. Just do good things as much as I can.</p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20220409233929.png" alt="I say it is a horse!"></p><h2 id="Cooking"><a href="#Cooking" class="headerlink" title="Cooking"></a>Cooking</h2><p>I AM FALLING IN LOVE WITH COOKING CHINESE FOOD.</p><p>I keep cooking every Sunday night no matter how busy I am. Although each time it took me 4 hours, 5pm to 9pm, to cook, eat and clean. I never thought I could fall in love with cooking rather than eating since I never cooked before and never wanted to cook back in China.</p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20220409235029.png" alt="I finally took advantage of the Wok"></p><p>But I was right about myself: if I am pushed to do so, I will do so. I love cooking partly because it is a way to resolve my miss to my hometown (mainly food and my car). Also it is also a great way to socialize with friends as we cook and share together.</p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20220409235134.png" alt="Happy Haojin"></p><p>After quite a few times of failures, I finally made the Coca-Cola Chicken Wing successfully. The moment I tasted the wing, I felt an enormous sense of satisfaction and achievement that I never had before. I finally found a true hobby that I am proud of. </p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20220409235212.png" alt="Dennis&#39;s Stirred Vegetable which was also really good"></p><p>Also when I saw the great amount of oil on the vegetable, I knew it is real Chinese food, this is the real family taste. </p><p>I can’t help imagining learning, trying and cooking all kinds of classic Chinese foods in the coming summer to serve my friends.</p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20220409235512.png" alt="BIG Bowl~"></p><h2 id="F1"><a href="#F1" class="headerlink" title="F1"></a>F1</h2><p>This is the sport I feel like March Madness is happening. Now I understand why people are so crazy about Duke basketball since I have the same or even higher level of craziness for F1. Especially this year the game dynamic has completely changed as Mercedes goes down and King’s return of Ferrari. In addition, our proud Chinese driver Zhou Guanyu has grasped the first-ever point in his first-ever F1 Grand Prix. There were so many dramas and will be more in the future. I am even writing my writing101 paper on Formula 1 which is not like other painful writing assignments and I gained a lot of happiness from doing so.</p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20220410000037.png" alt="What a race"></p><p><strong>Life is truly fantastic for me and I enjoy each and every second of it.</strong></p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20220410000328.png" alt="I just love this picture"></p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It’s been a crazy March that has nothing to do with March Madness, but crazier than March Madness.</p><span id="more"></span><p>I know it has been a long time since the last time I blogged. I was telling myself last semester that I could definitely keep blogging at least every week but it turned out not working at all for this semester. It is not because I am having a worse or not-worth-blogging life compared to the last semester. But on the contrary, I am having a great time, great than ever. I would love to blog everything post by post but I failed to do so. Therefore, here is all. </p><h2 id="Spring-Break"><a href="#Spring-Break" class="headerlink" title="Spring Break"></a>Spring Break</h2><h3 id="Washington-DC-Roadtrip"><a href="#Washington-DC-Roadtrip" class="headerlink" title="Washington DC Roadtrip"></a>Washington DC Roadtrip</h3><p>I never thought I could visit DC twice in three months. But here am I, the second time. What different is that I came with makenew folks, which I enjoyed a lot. I had a wried feeling that DC is very familiar to me even more than Beijing. I remember every street I have been to and every artifact in the museum that I have stopped by. Or just because I never visit a place twice within such a short period of time. However, this feeling is amazing partly because you start to appreciate things in the city rather than being surprised by new things. I could tell that I do love the city, the vibe and the history even though it’s short. I have a theory: 500 years is long that 5000 years. Why? Because you share a common perception of things 500 years ago but not for 5000 years’ since they were too old to understand and relate. This is how I feel about my city Xi’an, the most ancient city in China, and DC.</p><p>Two trips together, I have almost visited all the signature museums around National Mall. Frankly, there is no single piece of art or document that is unforgettable to me, but the general feeling is.</p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20220409224215.png" alt="Pretending I am the stone man"></p><p>For this trip, I enjoyed sitting in a micro dining room with friends while having <em>not spicy</em> ramen that kept me having a runny nose. It was super fun while carrying Daniel on my back in front of the monument. And I can’t stop laughing at myself that asking Sid to go American Indian Museum together, which has become a joke being told by friends over and over again. Also, making completely nonsense sentences in Nathan’s car with one word per person made me laugh for literally four hours. Most importantly, now I have the experience of sleeping with 10+ people on the ground of an Airbnb house.</p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20220409232313.png" alt="Also I was on Daniel&#39;s Back"></p><p>Also I mostly appreciate the time and commitment that makenew people devoted to this trip. I cannot even have a safe plan for four people last time here while they are organizing a trip for 30 people. Relate to what Tim said, I think they are great great testimony of Jesus.</p><h3 id="Asheville"><a href="#Asheville" class="headerlink" title="Asheville"></a>Asheville</h3><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20220409232125.png" alt="Chimney Rock"></p><p>The first, in the true sense, road trip I have ever had. American nature views are so different compared to China’s. There is an unspeakable difference between them. American mountains are more lively in my opinion while China’s are more awe-inspiring. </p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20220409230453.png" alt="group photo!"></p><p>The most memorable things: millions of times of <em>Country Road, Take Me Home</em>; Mr. Chou(ugly in Chinese) Diego; 4 hours of walking and almost climbing to see the fantastic overlook of the entire valley since our car couldn’t pass by the annoying bumps; jumping into 50F river and screaming and losing my glasses. I can’t be happier than all the above things brought to me.</p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20220409230537.png" alt="In the highest mist~"></p><p>Also an unremarkable but heartwarming scene: A father and 5-year-old boy sitting next to us while watching a mediocre sunset on a mediocre hill. I saw the father and boy interacting with each other in a so sweet way. I am envious of that and just can’t help thinking about what kind of father would I become and imagining all unrealistic family things. Unrealistic but exceedingly desirable.</p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20220409231936.png" alt="ZzzZZZzzzZZ"></p><p>Alllso, my birthday. I am so happy that I could celebrate all my birthdays during the break for at least the next 3 years of my life. This is the first birthday I had out of home, which is also the most appreciable birthday I had. I appreciate Mattew’s professional birthday songs and Andy and Min and Jordan’s unprofessional birthday songs. I felt far close to home while far away from home.</p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20220409231520.png" alt="Yo!"></p><h3 id="Birthday"><a href="#Birthday" class="headerlink" title="Birthday"></a>Birthday</h3><p>Yes, birthday again. I didn’t expect I would have another birthday on the following day we went back to Durham. I was surprised, moved and grateful. I wish there are words better than “thank you” to say to all the makenew folks. </p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20220409230635.png" alt="Of course without my glasses"></p><p>Plus I bought myself a gift. A newly released LEGO F1 car. I am not a fan of LEGO but a fan of F1. I enjoyed the process of building it. But this is probably the last LEGO I would purchase since it is so expensive haha. But this one is definitely worth it considering the additional value of emotional attachment.</p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20220409230708.png" alt="Good luck McLaren :("></p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We just lost the most important home game today. </p><span id="more"></span><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20220305233543.png" alt=":("></p><p>It’s only 10 PM but I feel like already 2 AM. The campus is so quiet and everybody I saw was upset with a bitter smile. For me, I am never into basketball and the result doesn’t matter much to me to some extent. However, I can feel the subtle change in my mood in such down campus vibe. A better thing is that it is finally the right time for me to sit down and calm down, reflecting on the past 2 months which I should have done early. </p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20220305223657.png" alt="Cooking and eating Scrambled eggs with tomatoes &amp; Cola Chicken Wings with friends "></p><p>So many things happened within two months. It was certainly much busier than the previous semester. I joined a new extracurricular club, got a part-time job in the OIT office, read a bunch of esoteric philosophy and sociology papers, pledged a national service fraternity, tried to cook Chinese food every weekend with friends… All of those, I enjoyed a lot, far more than I expected. </p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20220305223902.png" alt="I am that &quot;secruity guy&quot; next to the door in the APO Induction"></p><p>The world also has been changed a lot. Bad things happened. The Russia-Ukraine War has been imposed huge impacts on each and every aspect of people’s lives, globally. I remember debating with my friends on the roles those world leaders play in such incidents. We could not agree with each other. Nobody could agree with anybody. There are people in the student group chat raising money for the Ukrainian military, joking on “Let’s go Russia”. There are all kinds of people in this world, no matter which part. I have experienced a great sense of hostility and extremity around my daily life, the Internet life, and the lands far away. Nevertheless, I hold an optimist’s view of the world, or at least, for the world I perceive. Recently I have taken up a routine of reading every day before going to bed. From the book A Wavy Life 人生海海, I learned that “The life is not what you have lived for, the life is what you have remembered for”. Relating to my current understanding and experience, I enjoy the moment no matter I stepped up or I gave in.</p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20220305224042.png" alt="The BEST dessert place I&#39;ve ever been to, changed my opinion on boba"></p><p>Also, I celebrated the first-ever Chinese New Year away from home. It was refreshing and memorable. I wrapped almost hundreds of dumplings with friends from the church. I bought a lot of classic snacks and just wanted to show my gratitude to this special community. It was the first new year I didn’t watch CCTV Gala. Yet, worth celebrating and remembering for years.</p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20220305224219.png" alt="Chinese New Year&#39;s Night!"></p><p>It brings me thoughts onto the religion now. Recently I finished a short introduction book to Christianity by the pastor. It was not mind-blowing but brought up my attention and curiosity to examine the religion and metaphysical questions like what I live for. I always believed in there exists a God who created this beloved world. However, I am still not sure who he is. What does a God truly mean to me, my life, my future, and even my afterlife? As for now, I believe my friends believe for a reason. I believe I desperately want to learn more.</p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20220305224348.png" alt="I like the weather so much"></p><p>The most rewarding thing this semester so far is the comments by my writing 101 class professor. This is also the most rewarding class for me this semester. I do feel like I have learned a lot from this class in terms of writing skills and the mindset to perceive the world. As we learned about the labor of sports, contemporary spectator sports is more than an entertaining sport. It is an institution that could suppress humanity, widen inequality and lead to consequences. Everything is doubtful, no matter how good or bad it looks.</p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20220305223321.png"></p><p>Life goes on and on~ </p><p>Spring break starts now. </p><p>Warmly,</p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20220305224808.png" alt="Well, I appreaciate you said that"></p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Finally, it comes to the beginning of another wonderful semester. </p><span id="more"></span><p>Unlike high school time which I genuinely didn’t like switching from sweet and chilled breaks to a busy school semester, I do look forward to the college semester. Probably because it was just so boring during my winter break when I went to Washington DC and came back staying on campus for most of the break. Most importantly, I missed the people I met here including friends and strangers. I enjoyed interacting with people and striking basic conversation with “How are you?”.</p><p>Actually, last week was the first week of class since the semester began last Wednesday. But generally, I enjoyed this whole one and a half starting week though it was completely on zoom. It wasn’t bad at all compared to what I thought would be like. Back in high school, I only had a short experience of online school for a few months and frankly, I learned nothing during that time with all the distractions at home. So I made a judgment that I wouldn’t make it during online learning. However, I did learn a lot and met with new classmates this week via zoom. I had the same feeling of excitement and satisfaction after a long and sometimes internet-lagged zoom meeting. I still got a chance to understand different perspectives on sports, capitalism, philosophy through all my classes which I love a lot based on what’s going on now.</p><p>I keep cooking sometimes this week, mostly because I bought a lot of stuff during winter break and they were going to expire. It was exciting making my own food and feeding myself. It is even more exciting to cook and serve for your friends. We talked, we joked, we laughed while cooking and having meals together. I hope to keep this up through the entire semester.</p><p>There was also a dramatic moment last Saturday when I was mistakenly being told of getting positive on covid while waiting in the line for my first duke basketball game. I called my roommate and we decided to have him stay at a hotel tonight before I figured out this mess of covid. Then I informed all the people I had contact with recently. After that I just sit down alone in my room, self-talking that oh it’s the best time to get covid since I’ll have a great chance of getting recovered before classes in-person, plus sooner or later I’ll get covid based on the roaring of cases. Around 11 PM, I received another email from Duke saying that they are happy to let me know I am not positive due to their mistake. I was relieved at first and then pissed off by their unprofessional actions. I texted all my friends again saying that I am not positive at all and I am gonna sue Duke to get my tuition back even. Anyway, it was a funny experience for me and reminded me I do not want to get covid at all even it’s not as serious as it was. It will affect people around you, persons you care about.</p><p>I met with my friends from makenew a lot this week. I love hanging out with them and sometimes we could talk about some deeper philosophical topics which I enjoyed a lot. I just love getting to know people here and respect them a lot for what they do and what they are trying to achieve.</p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20220115233017.png" alt="Watching movie &quot;Belle&quot;"></p><p>Well, I don’t know why I decide to write a blog in English this time but I’d like to do that ever since now if my future-me don’t mind. It’s time to struggle with written English and beg to get decent grades in both writing and philosophy classes. </p><p>Best of luck.</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>很多人称这一年为被偷走的一年，于我而言，却意义非凡。是重大的转折，又仿佛是日出时分，朝霞最亮，最广阔，拥有能够扩展整个天空的野心的时刻。</p><span id="more"></span><h2 id="Pre-college-Life"><a href="#Pre-college-Life" class="headerlink" title="Pre-college Life"></a>Pre-college Life</h2><h3 id="后申请季"><a href="#后申请季" class="headerlink" title="后申请季"></a>后申请季</h3><p>还记得去年的12月31号的跨年夜，我在利用最后的机会考duolingo。当时压力很大，每天和黑夜作伴，那种黑暗吞噬一切的恐怖感相比文书反复折磨和由于标化成绩给自己带来的不自信感来说不值一提。一直持续到一月末，都过着“生不如死”，绞尽脑汁写文书的日子。不愿再回首，不愿再经历，但我知道那段时光教会了我如何去忍耐，去选择相信，去咬牙坚持下去。</p><p>犹记得学校的元旦晚会，自己当天可能只睡了两三个小时，别人在载歌载舞，我在海量的学校文书里挣扎，电脑屏幕桌面就是密密麻麻的文书一二三四五稿。可能是过的最痛苦的一个元旦了，看着拿到offer的同学欢庆新年，内心隐隐作痛，恨自己。</p><h3 id="Offer雨"><a href="#Offer雨" class="headerlink" title="Offer雨"></a>Offer雨</h3><p>之后该发生的一切都发生了。拿到了不错的offer，在出租屋里声泪俱下，早上七点撕裂的尖叫声在楼道里上蹿下跳，在和母亲的电话里说“我终于证明了自己，我就要让不相信自己的人看一看！”</p><h3 id="毕业季"><a href="#毕业季" class="headerlink" title="毕业季"></a>毕业季</h3><p>拿到offer之后的学校生活很枯燥却又很有趣。上课学习知识的动力是真的没有了，一天最开心的可能就是和同学玩游戏。三天掌握斗地主，七天重拾狂野飙车，我知道每一刻都很珍贵，无论过去当下未来，享受就好。</p><p>人生的第一个大目标算是达成了，有了更多的时间去填补作为一个人的社会属性。我终于可以周末约着同学去吃饭，去看电影，去滑雪，去玩，去社交。在这个过程中，收获了至今跨越整个美洲大陆的友谊，也许是我拥有的第一份真正的友谊。</p><h3 id="暑假"><a href="#暑假" class="headerlink" title="暑假"></a>暑假</h3><p>也可以说我这个暑假是被偷走了的，因为没有干什么正事。参加的夏校让我深刻认识到了自己不是科研的料，自己从未想过我可以做出果断退出的抉择。当然，拿到了驾照算是一件事。当我坐在车里，开车穿行在西安的大街小巷，能够带朋友出去看电影，大晚上把车停在十字路口，驱车三十余公里去农家乐烧烤打麻将，我感觉这是我最有成年的感觉的时刻。我学会了开车，我可以去自己想去的地方了。甚至现在，我并不想家，唯一想的是开车的那种感觉，或者也许是那种让我自身说服已经成长的错觉。</p><p>当然，这段时间最重要的另一件事情就是感恩。去小学初中高中感恩每一位教书育人的老师，感恩高考结束的天才同学们，感恩懵懂时期稚嫩的感情，为一切都算是画上了一个圆满的句号。我知道未来有一天，我一定要向母校捐款，我要让他们以我为豪。总是大家总是拿学校开玩笑，但一切的机遇和经历，都是在这些地方发生的，无论好坏，塑造了现在的我，我必将感恩致谢。这是父母教导我的，是我通过亲身经历所相信的，感恩身边的每一个人，他们让你在时间成丝的现在时成为了自己。</p><h2 id="College-Life"><a href="#College-Life" class="headerlink" title="College Life"></a>College Life</h2><h3 id="Orientation-Week"><a href="#Orientation-Week" class="headerlink" title="Orientation Week"></a>Orientation Week</h3><p>怎么说，超出想象的好。orientation week算是我性格一百八十度大转变的时候，记得刚到学习哦啊还是非常拘谨自卑，真的发现自己是全校英语最差的人了，完全不敢和别人交流。一天晚上被叫出去打牌，我甚至不知道怎么用英文说扑克牌，但那天晚上我真的突然茅塞顿开，不再恐惧，英语张口就来，甚至晚上回去和中国室友狂飙英文。那段时间不上课，有更多的时间去社交，大家交友也不是出于课程抱大腿之类的意图，交友非常地纯粹。我也很感激在那段时间交到了现在非常好的朋友们。牌友变朋友，晚上散步，GADU偶遇church group，每一段看似机缘巧合的经历却构成了我第一个学期的主旋律。</p><h3 id="接下来的日子"><a href="#接下来的日子" class="headerlink" title="接下来的日子"></a>接下来的日子</h3><p>岁月静好，做了中国精准脱贫的presentation，请上课口头禅“shit”的professor吃了flunch，尝试了rowing社团看到了凌晨五点的星辰和日出，通过滑冰由衷地发现了值得欣赏的人儿。一堂课两个半小时的presentation，多到爆炸的数学作业，每次能让我跳脱思想框架的ethics what now program，我真的蛮开心的。</p><p>和church group friends的相处让我开始了解一种信仰，结识了很多朋友，体验了很多传统的美国活动，corn maze，篝火，Marshmallow，beach，一切的一切，我很感恩，很开心，这就是享受生活，发现小小的感动，汇聚成一个又一个幸福绽放的美丽的烟火。</p><h2 id="Winter-Break-Life"><a href="#Winter-Break-Life" class="headerlink" title="Winter Break Life"></a>Winter Break Life</h2><h3 id="Washington-DC"><a href="#Washington-DC" class="headerlink" title="Washington DC"></a>Washington DC</h3><p>一国之都，还是有其独特的风格和底蕴。大理石的纪念堂，若大穹顶的博物馆，欧洲风情的Georgetown小镇，让这座城市别具一格。最喜欢的，其实是这里的食物，其实就是中餐。我们甚至品尝到了习主席访美时的菜肴，还是我的家乡菜。远在家乡万里之外品尝到凉皮肉夹馍的那一刻，眼泪都忍不之掉了下来。我万万想不到半年前大街小巷都能吃到的凉皮如今连汤汁都不愿舍弃。</p><p>这座城市让我看到了美国开国元勋们对于政治理想的追求，也让我看到了这个国家后辈一代一代人对历史的尊敬和浪漫。美国历史不长，记录得却很详细，从无数个博物馆，我看到了无数件文件，图画，物件，影像等等从各个方面佐证独一件事情。</p><h3 id="学做饭"><a href="#学做饭" class="headerlink" title="学做饭"></a>学做饭</h3><p>回到学校，和住在监狱里没有两样。每天唯一的活动就是出去吃饭，晚上打牌。圣诞假期甚至连外出吃饭的权力都被剥夺了，不得不开始自己做饭。从最开始各种苦笑不得的错误，到吃上人生第一个自己红烧的鸡腿，再到连吃3天红烧鸡腿，再到自己煎牛排，煮菜，一步一步，也算是能养活自己了。甚至还有些喜欢做饭，就像父母很早之前所说的，做饭是一项很重要的生活能力，书读的再好，也得学会生活。</p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20220105003323.png" alt="简单的鸡蛋挂面配红烧鸡腿，火腿，胡萝卜和黄瓜"></p><h3 id="圣诞夜，元旦和今夜"><a href="#圣诞夜，元旦和今夜" class="headerlink" title="圣诞夜，元旦和今夜"></a>圣诞夜，元旦和今夜</h3><p>圣诞夜又喝醉了。朋友邀请我喝龙舌兰、打牌。第一次知道需要吃青柠，沾粗盐，然后才是喝酒。喝着喝着就失去了度，也许是圣诞夜太孤独，想着喝醉也无妨。人生第一次喝吐了，在朋友的房间里打滚，在走廊里光着上身乱跑，第二天迷迷糊糊把新买的耳机连同衣服一起洗了，吃了又吐。给一同的朋友们造成了很大的麻烦。但回想起来还是很开心，酒，真的能消愁。</p><p>12月31号晚上，我们一行六人去吃心心念念的火锅。为了一顿火锅，我洗了澡，换了新衣服，期待了两三天。真正吃上的时候，很是满足。半个小时车程，车费接近火锅费用，因此火锅算是一把奢侈。六个背景截然不同的男生在新年夜说着中国话想着怎么最大限度白嫖自助火锅。同样的，格外开心。</p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20220105003412.png" alt="吃火锅到撑"></p><p>昨天，duke下雪了，我来这里的第一场大雪，也是今年的第一场大雪。出乎意料的，下午雪就完全藏匿了踪迹，无处可循。但雪触及这里的早上，是真实的，美好的。</p><p>今夜，1月4号晚上，母亲的生日，开学的前夜，终于把这份本应在去年完成的年终报告写完了。很期待新的课程，唯一遗憾的是前两周改成了线上授课，只希望一切都会好起来。</p><p>祝好。</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>今天算是比较chill的一天，唯一的行程就是National Zoo。说来惭愧，作为一个中国人第一次看到大熊猫居然是在美国首都。</p><span id="more"></span><h2 id="南非美食"><a href="#南非美食" class="headerlink" title="南非美食"></a>南非美食</h2><p>早起吃完早餐，又睡了一个回笼觉。在城市里最幸福的就是每天可以打开yelp选择数不尽的各地美食。我们选择了动物园旁边的一家南非美食。点餐的时候，辣度分为5档，我迟疑了，最后选择了第二辣。尝到鸡肉的第一口，就后悔应该选择最辣的了。但总的来说，鸡肉非常嫩，哪怕是在最里面的部分。</p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20211221204452.png" alt="signature half chicken"></p><h2 id="国家动物园"><a href="#国家动物园" class="headerlink" title="国家动物园"></a>国家动物园</h2><p>动物园和其他经典一样，也都是完全免费的。入园后的前几个景点发现动物都没有出来，可能是天气太冷了，睡着了。但当看到熊猫的时候，一切都值了。真的超出想象的可爱，他们笨拙的步伐，我甚至看到了一个大熊猫爬上树梢，一不小心摔了下来的画面，在地面上翻了几个跟头。众人发出了被萌化的声音哈哈。</p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20211221204815.png" alt="在山坡上的熊猫"></p><p>之后参观了好几个室内的展馆，看到了我见过的最大的鱼，足足有两米长，和人类相当。照片现在再看，确实还有些害怕，这里就不放图片了。</p><p>出乎意料的是，我看到了各种各样的蛇。之前的我是从来不敢看蛇的，连照片都能让我冷汗直冒。而这次，隔着一层玻璃却能够眼不眨心不跳地静静观赏，也许是自己真的长大了？童年最大的恐惧现在看来也都不算什么了。</p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20211221205035.png" alt="动物园留影"></p><h2 id="川陕人家"><a href="#川陕人家" class="headerlink" title="川陕人家"></a>川陕人家</h2><p>我们坐车30分钟才到了这家让我心心念念的餐馆。翻开菜单的第一页写着“本店肉夹馍为习近平主席访美期间指定特供食品”，而吃完的体验也着实证明了确实是款待国宾的上佳菜肴。凉皮和夫妻肺片上来的那一刻，整个人的细胞像是被激活了一样，连平常不喜欢吃的豆芽也都吃得一干二净。能够在异国他乡尝到一口正宗的家乡菜，真的太美好，太难了。</p><p>最后吃的非常饱，从来没有这么感激过一顿饭菜。</p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20211221205403.png" alt="餐厅内的装潢"></p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>今天的行程比较松散，中午才从住处出发。主要徒步浏览了Georgetown还有Georgetown大学。当然，还有最爱的胡辣汤。</p><span id="more"></span><h2 id="Georgetown"><a href="#Georgetown" class="headerlink" title="Georgetown"></a>Georgetown</h2><p>从住家步行，大概30分钟就到了Georgetown，类似于国内的历史文化保护区，这里也是颇有历史，很多小国的大使馆就藏匿在众多餐厅酒吧之间，我们看到了阿塞拜疆、巴勒斯坦等等。中午我们去了一个泰式餐厅，准确的来说是酒吧，所以中午并没有几个人在那里就餐。食物上乘，尤其喜欢带有一丝甜味的咖喱酱，与印度咖喱口味泾渭分明，却也各有特色。</p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20211219224856.png" alt="颇有欧洲风情的Georgetown，当然我也从未去过欧洲。"></p><p>之后我们前往非常有名的Georgetown Cupcake，排队长度比想象中的短，排队时间却比想象中的久多了。再加上寒风呼啸，着实不好受。但不得不说，cupcake还是非常好吃的，各种味道也有不同的特色，但可能对于我一个中国人来说还是甜过头了。总的来说比较推荐，卖相也很好，拍照自然是首选。</p><h2 id="Waterfront-Park"><a href="#Waterfront-Park" class="headerlink" title="Waterfront Park"></a>Waterfront Park</h2><p>沿着Georgetown一路下坡，就到了河边，景色不能说很美，但给人一种非常沉寂，放空的感觉。无意间我们发现公园尽头的建筑物就是著名的水门事件发生地，美国民主党总部水门综合大楼。岸边有很多海鸥，甚至有一个还短暂停在了栏杆上，可惜我没反应过来拍照，海鸥就飞走了。</p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20211219225247.png" alt="水门大楼和右侧被头挡住的肯尼迪艺术中心，晚上会有七彩的灯光投射"></p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20211219225511.png" alt="应该是海鸥吧"></p><h2 id="Georgetown-University"><a href="#Georgetown-University" class="headerlink" title="Georgetown University"></a>Georgetown University</h2><p>继续走路，来到了乔治城大学。其实这个学校和我们学校有很多的相似之处，比如标志性建筑都是比较复古的建筑物，且都有教堂。学校给我的感觉是非常紧凑，教学楼、音乐厅、宿舍都无序有机地坐落在高度上下起伏的校园里。校园里甚至还有一片墓地。同行的朋友都认为这里的设施比较新，比duke好多了，但我却认为还是duke好，建筑物规规整整地分布在校园里，给人以不争不抢的感觉。有崭新的教学楼，也有想我的宿舍一样的老建筑物，但我似乎是习惯了，出来参观其他学校才发现竟也爱上了自己的学校，对其他学校完全没有感觉。</p><div class="justified-gallery"><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20211219225541.png"></p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20211219230033.png"></p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20211219230049.png"></p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20211219230114.png"></p></div><h2 id="胡辣汤"><a href="#胡辣汤" class="headerlink" title="胡辣汤"></a>胡辣汤</h2><p>受到学长的邀请，去他家吃他自己做的胡辣汤。不得不说，油泼辣子和那股浓重的胡椒味，让我想起了家乡。万里之外异国他乡，能够拜访来自同一个小地方的学长，于我而言真的是一种幸运。希望未来还有机会再见。</p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20211219231020.png" alt="与学长的合影"></p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>今天混迹于各个博物馆之间，算是把美国的历史全方位各角度体验了一番，颇有收获。</p><span id="more"></span><h2 id="International-Spy-Museum"><a href="#International-Spy-Museum" class="headerlink" title="International Spy Museum"></a>International Spy Museum</h2><p>受朋友的推荐，早早预订了间谍博物馆的门票，其实这也是唯一一个需要收费的博物馆。整个浏览穿插着一些交互式的游戏，每个人都有一张id卡，会记录你的选择并在最后生成总结。总的来说，噱头大于实际意义，但仍是富有创意。</p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20211219215651.png" alt="我的间谍ID卡，中间丢了一次，见到了别人的。比较遗憾最后没有收到自己准确的统计"></p><p>博物馆里看到了很多真实的，用于实战的间谍设备，伪装设备还有真人轶事。尤其佩服美国人的自嘲精神，甚至揭露了很多美国情报组织的dirty work。另外感到意外的，还有博物馆陈列了大量前苏联的装备，甚至在这一个博物馆里，你就能感受到强烈的冷战氛围。两个大国的角逐博弈，成为了众多博物馆的主题或者说是副标题。</p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20211219220605.png" alt="KGB行动"></p><p>影响最深的还是乌克兰前总统经过KGB投毒之后毁容的照片，查询中国情报机构显示“Unavailable”，法航在飞往纽约的商务舱上安装窃听装置，现在听起来甚至都有些令人发笑，但这些确实实实在在发生过的历史，着实令人感到历史的魅力，以及保存博物的意义，哪怕是博后人一笑，也让这些事迹通过各种方式保存了下来。</p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20211219220624.png" alt="美苏对峙"></p><h2 id="National-History-Museum"><a href="#National-History-Museum" class="headerlink" title="National History Museum"></a>National History Museum</h2><p>在有恐龙化石和一群小朋友的Natural history museum和National history museum里，我们选择了national history museum. 毕竟恐龙化石在哪里都能看到，美国自己诉说陈列的历史只有在这里能看到。</p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20211219220903.png" alt="门前合影"></p><p>我们参观的第一个主题展，就是美国的战争史，从独立战争讲起。而这些内容，我们或多或少在致之前的spy museum还有昨天的国家图书馆，华盛顿纪念碑都已经阅读到、接触到了数遍。个人来讲，确实感觉到美国历史时间跨度之短，重要的事件究极归纳也就几件，来来回回反反复复地在各种博物馆通过不同的实物、方式讲述。当然，我能深刻地感受到美国人对历史的尊重和保护，短短一个事件，他们能从每一个维度作证、讲述、纪念和宣扬，这可能是我们中国做不到的，或许是因为意识不到位，亦或许只是历史长河漫漫罢了。</p><p>总的来说还是值得观看的，印象比较深刻的是美国总统和第一夫人展，展出了很多件不同第一夫人的礼服，于我而言算是一桩奇闻逸事。还有美国公民展，讲述了美国人对于自己身份的解读以及投票权的宣传。规模较小的钱币展也颇有意思，在那里你能看到面值十万元的美元钞票。</p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20211219221644.png" alt="曾经流通过的大额美钞"></p><h2 id="National-Archive"><a href="#National-Archive" class="headerlink" title="National Archive"></a>National Archive</h2><p>因为独立宣言原件保存于此而慕名而来。这是我们参观的所有博物馆当中唯一禁止在整个馆内照相的。看到了很多佐证美国历史，具有历史意义的书信、契约以及其他文本形式的记录。</p><p>存放宪法和独立宣言原件的地方是一个单独的地方，非常宏伟的拱形天花板，偌大的圆形展厅内唯一的陈列物就是这些已经很难看清字迹、保存在特殊光线照射的玻璃罩内的文件了。同样的，虽然看不懂几个字，却也为这些文件能够保存至今而感到震撼，美国的立国之本就在我的面前，数百年前美国开国元勋们的字迹在我面前呈现，作为一个中国人，总结这几天的博物馆之旅，说实话我可能还无法理解美国的价值观，但我表示尊重。</p><h2 id="Shopping-Mall"><a href="#Shopping-Mall" class="headerlink" title="Shopping Mall"></a>Shopping Mall</h2><p>因为好友来自这里，他驱车来接我们前往pentagon city的一个shopping mall吃饭。非常巧地遇见了之前yelp上随机点开的中餐馆，于是便进入就餐。最开始我害怕外国友人吃不惯中餐炒鸡蛋，但看好友一盘子米饭解决得干干净净，我也是十分开心。来这里，明显能感觉到不是所有人都喜欢吃中餐的，完全不是国内宣传的那个样子，吃中餐的还是中国人。我们瞧不起异域的食物，他们亦是。所以看到好友的反应，我才松了口气，没有让他感到不舒服。</p><p>之后他请我吃了他最爱的类似于烤面包条的东西，具体的名字我又忘了，但这些都不重要，我是真心能感受到和好友的距离一下子拉近了很多，我们种族不同，甚至如果不是duke，一辈子都不可能有交集。他能够开车接送我们，给我们参谋dc的旅行计划，我感到非常地感激。最后他把我们送到家，专门说想和我照一张相，我真的很是感动。我知道，这是值得深交，未来一辈子的朋友。我们有不同的文化，不同的信仰，不同的肤色，甚至不同的爱好，但我们冥冥之中有一无法言说的地方相通，让我们成为了朋友。祝他寒假一切顺利，来年校园再见！</p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20211219223054.png" alt="我和好友"></p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>寒假了，大家又都各奔东西。美国的假期确实好多，让我不知如何是好。漫长的寒假还是决定出去走一走，尽管一个月前刚从纽约回来。</p><span id="more"></span><p>我原以为继纽约之后，不会再有哪一座城市能够像纽约一样独特，标志性和繁华。在来到之前，我对于美国地域划分成了两类：一类是如Durham地广人稀，一类如纽约紧凑繁华。看到DC的第一眼，我就打破了自己的关键，美国这里当然还有第三个分类，就是DC。或者说每探索一个新城市，我都觉得有非常独一无二的闪光点，是完全与众不同的。</p><h2 id="第零天"><a href="#第零天" class="headerlink" title="第零天"></a>第零天</h2><h3 id="降落"><a href="#降落" class="headerlink" title="降落"></a>降落</h3><p>没有想到飞机降落的路线即飞掠National Mall，能够俯瞰所有重要地标。着实是很兴奋。另一是从空中看到了很多联排的小别墅，别有欧洲风情，这是我所探索的地方所未见的。</p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20211217224050.png" alt="Washington Monument, US Capitol, Reflecting Pool"></p><p>下飞机之后，出了机场就看到了地铁高架，坐上车，第一感觉是整个城市非常干净，给人一种很清新的感觉。</p><h3 id="住家"><a href="#住家" class="headerlink" title="住家"></a>住家</h3><p>我们四人一行，预定的是联排别墅这样的Airbnb，host非常热情，整个房子也非常大。唯一没想到的是两个人住在地下室，两个人住在二层，但其实非常的温馨，也足够睡一个安稳觉了。</p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20211217224941.png" alt="住家外景"></p><h2 id="第一天"><a href="#第一天" class="headerlink" title="第一天"></a>第一天</h2><h3 id="早餐"><a href="#早餐" class="headerlink" title="早餐"></a>早餐</h3><p>Host非常友好地为我们免费提供了早餐，这也是我唯一能早上八点半起来的原因了。是一顿非常美式的早餐，有bagel，奶酪，水果，热茶和果汁。意外的好吃。</p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20211217225134.png" alt="早餐"></p><h3 id="US-Capitol"><a href="#US-Capitol" class="headerlink" title="US Capitol"></a>US Capitol</h3><p>驱车十余分钟便到达了首都的中心地带，可能是因为工作日加上圣诞假期，街道上非常冷清。我们步入国会广场，我们甚至是唯一的游客。由于疫情，或者说其他原因，国会内部并不对外开放。我们一行人在门外留影之后便前往仅一路之隔的美国最高法院和国会图书馆。真的很难想象，不远的之前这里挤满了抗议叛乱的人群。如今，空无一人，只剩荷枪实弹的警卫和寥寥无几的游客。</p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20211217225516.png" alt="国会大厦"></p><h3 id="US-Supreme-Court-amp-Library-of-Congress"><a href="#US-Supreme-Court-amp-Library-of-Congress" class="headerlink" title="US Supreme Court &amp; Library of Congress"></a>US Supreme Court &amp; Library of Congress</h3><p>最高法院是典型的希腊式建筑（？），给人以庄严肃穆的感觉，洁白的大理石确实让人敬意油然而生。同样的，空无一人，只能够在门口拍照合影。Three pillars of power. 立法权和司法权标志性建筑隔街相望，互相制衡。首都的建筑设计确实精妙，富含寓意。</p><p>图书馆也是非常典型的希腊式建筑，我们进入了建筑内部，但却深知没有见到一本书，就因为时间原因折返。但内部的装潢确实一贯的优雅，不知为什么，并没有多少年历史的西方建筑，却让我能够体会到更厚重的历史感。或许是近代的历史是我能够共通理解的历史，再往远古追溯，与我们现代人类已少了很多联系。</p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20211217230159.png" alt="最高法院"></p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20211217230220.png" alt="国会图书馆"></p><h3 id="National-Air-and-Space-Museum"><a href="#National-Air-and-Space-Museum" class="headerlink" title="National Air and Space Museum"></a>National Air and Space Museum</h3><p>其实对这里的期待很高，但参观完也就感觉中规中矩，唯一令我印象深刻的是有很多前苏联的模型展出，美国也大方地承认了前苏联在太空竞赛中的各项成就，甚至对其还有详尽的研究。余下的时间，我和朋友尝试了战斗机模拟器，其实和我在西雅度波音博物馆里的体验机器一模一样，但还是非常享受。</p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20211217230357.png" alt="博物馆大厅，可以看到前苏联和美国的火箭和载人飞船模型"></p><h3 id="Washington-Monument"><a href="#Washington-Monument" class="headerlink" title="Washington Monument"></a>Washington Monument</h3><p>之后，我们沿着National Mall一路步行，前往华盛顿纪念碑。整个区域给人感觉非常的规整，静谧，555英尺的纪念碑独立在市中心，静静地，不争，见证了美国这一新兴国家的崛起。</p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20211217230905.png" alt="从林肯纪念堂方向瞭看华盛顿纪念碑"></p><p>走进仰望，比我想象中的高大了许多。作为世界上最大的单体石头构造建筑，能够看到偏底座部分和偏上部分使用的是不同的石头，因为纪念碑的建造因为内战停工了数年，再次开工发现原来的石头产地已经被挖空了。</p><p>没错，纪念碑是可以乘电梯上到顶部的。很难想象这是将近150年前的建筑，站在首都的最高处，风景很是独特。我沿着东南西北四个方向转了一圈，很多的纪念碑与重要建筑物，能够感受到首都的独特之处。</p><div class="justified-gallery"><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20211217231222.png"></p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20211217231238.png"></p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20211217231255.png"></p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20211217231312.png"></p></div><h3 id="White-House"><a href="#White-House" class="headerlink" title="White House"></a>White House</h3><p>白宫在我的印象里是很大的，巨大的草坪，巨大的连体建筑，但实际上出乎我的意料，只是一座非常不起眼的建筑，尤其是和周围的建筑物相比。唯一能提的，可能就是这是华盛顿最老的建筑了吧。想一想Biden在这么小的地方办公，也是为他感到一丝丝委屈。反而旁边的财政部，商务部还有Executive Office Building非常有建筑风格，格外恢弘。</p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20211217231637.png"></p><h3 id="Lincoln-Memorial"><a href="#Lincoln-Memorial" class="headerlink" title="Lincoln Memorial"></a>Lincoln Memorial</h3><p>马丁路德金就是在这里的第18阶台阶上进行了著名的《我有一个梦想》演讲，很难想象整个广场被人群挤满的景象真是存在在上个世纪。进到内部，是巨大的林肯坐相。这让我想起了小时候去过的中正纪念堂，和林肯纪念堂其实布局建筑非常相似。</p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20211217231953.png" alt="林肯纪念堂"></p><h3 id="夜游DC"><a href="#夜游DC" class="headerlink" title="夜游DC"></a>夜游DC</h3><p>晚饭在一家非常fancy的餐厅，牛排还可以，就是上菜非常慢。由于预约了夜游大巴的门票，我们一行四人疯狂奔跑在dc的街头，终于赶上了大巴。解说非常风趣幽默，我印象最深的是”On our left you can see the FBI building. Feel free to take pictures. I’m sure they are taking pictures of you, too”. </p><p>算是把白天看过的景点又重温了一遍，但多了解说，确实又了解了很多背后的轶事。历史真的充满令人恐怖的巧合。</p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20211217232501.png" alt="反思池和林肯纪念堂"><br><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20211217232602.png" alt="杰斐逊纪念堂，孑然屹立"><br><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20211217232649.png" alt="晚上的肯尼迪中心由于灯光的照映分外闪耀"><br><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20211217232747.png" alt="二战纪念碑"><br><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20211217232807.png" alt="国会和从加州运来的圣诞树"></p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>What a drive! 早上八点钟就爬起来，静候F1 2021年的最后一场大奖赛——阿布扎比亚斯码头。作为这个暑假才爱上的运动，能够在第一个入坑的赛季就赶上如此激烈、意义非凡的一季，实属幸运。</p><span id="more"></span><p>从比赛开始，Max失去pole之后，其实局势就已经沉静下来了，Max无论是换各种胎还是Perez神级挡车，都没有出现那种凌空一现打破僵局的时刻。作为偏向Max的粉丝（其实是主要喜欢Perez，顺带喜欢红牛车队），我觉得可能冠军之争已经尘埃落定了。即使有安全车出现，也是无济于事。比赛中期的时候，我甚至睡了过去，直到Perez强硬防守Lewis才被重新激动起来的解说吵醒了。</p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/image-20211212181920891.jpg" alt="发车"></p><h2 id="Perez"><a href="#Perez" class="headerlink" title="Perez"></a>Perez</h2><p>说回Perez，我认为这是最好的队友，最好的防守。我并不懂各种详细的赛车参数，但只是纯粹的超车以及攻守对抗，就能让人肾上腺素爆满。果然，这是我喜欢的车手，他一直有着从最后一名到第一的那种勇气。</p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/3px1dsib84581.jpg.webp" alt="PER vs. HAM"></p><h2 id="最后一圈"><a href="#最后一圈" class="headerlink" title="最后一圈"></a>最后一圈</h2><p>就是这一圈，让我认定了这是我看过所有的F1比赛中最戏剧性的一场，也是最鼓舞人心的一场。抛开FIA的判罚，最后一圈决定2021一整年的冠军确实让人不得不激动起来。当我看到Max的车在镜头里，两辆车几乎是在向前爬行，甚至能感觉到安全车释放的最后一秒Max车身甚至超过了Lewis。那一瞬间，我能感受到Max内心雄狮一样的力量和精神崛起，以及Lewis些许的无奈。也不知道是哪个转角，当Max成功超越Lewis，我在宿舍里尖叫了起来，好久都没有为竞技体育而如此兴奋过了。</p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/image-20211212181640486.jpg" alt="Verstappen overtakes Hamilton in epic last lap  to win Formula 1 World Championship"></p><h2 id="整个赛季"><a href="#整个赛季" class="headerlink" title="整个赛季"></a>整个赛季</h2><p>F1 2021是我第一个观看整整一整赛季的运动，围场内外让我这个半拉子粉丝也享受其中。喜欢瞬息万变的局面，喜欢每一次策略制胜的巧妙，喜欢周冠宇官宣的中国时刻。</p><p>F1注定无法像足球篮球一样成为大众普及的运动，但它独有的魅力令无数人着迷，其中也包括我。这种既有爆发力，有需要耐力的比赛需要观众的肾上腺素，也需要观众的耐心。我看F1的过程，夸张一点，就是培养心性的过程，从最开始看不完整场比赛只看highlight到现在能够一大早爬起来完完整整地看完正赛，收获了耐心，也从更多的角度理解了F1比赛，除了感官的冲击，更是为各个车队的策略所吸引着迷。希望下个赛季能够开始去看排位赛甚至练习赛吧。</p><p> 最终的结局我很满意。我认为constructor champ完美地代表了最高水平的车队水平，Mercedes当之无愧。driver champ代表了勇气，运气，实力以及种种因素的集合，Max也是当之无愧。我清晰地记得Lewis在两次安全车时都要求进展，但车队为了保持现有优势，做出了保守的按兵不动的策略。可见Lewis还是有承担风险的那份勇气和胆识的，只是车队没有，当然这也是客观因素所决定的，没有人会在当前优势下去放弃相当重要的一部分。但是红牛就是因为nothing to lose而赢了比赛。</p><p>这个赛季的走向我很喜欢，运气的重要程度往往超过人们的想象，墨菲定律的成功率甚至也超过人们的想象。我们在2021最后一个旧赛季迎来了新王登基，我相信下一年的比赛会更加精彩。</p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/racefansdotnet-21-12-12-22-55-25-5.jpg" alt="新王登基！"></p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>从纽约回来之后，立马就进入了期末考试周。周二回来，周五就进行了第一场期末考试，时间过的真快。但确实是不太适应Thanksgiving和Winter break间隔如此之近。</p><span id="more"></span><p>我以为自己回来之后会非常想念纽约的吃喝玩乐之行，但并没有。只是有时候感慨两边截然不同的生活方式和学习氛围，时常感到庆幸，Duke真的是适合我的学校。</p><h2 id="结课"><a href="#结课" class="headerlink" title="结课"></a>结课</h2><p>这周我所有的课都是最后一节了，着实是有些感伤，当然只针对一些课程。CS201虽然是个大课，但真的结束的时候，也怀念自己做apt的时光，怀念和朋友绞尽脑汁做project的时光，还有每次上课和朋友坐在第一排的“观影体验”。这是一门没有很大压力，算是一个衔接课吧，下学期的210就要真的开始学习计算机了。</p><p>Grody的leadership也是我一定会非常怀念的一节课，说实话其实课程内容设置并不是很好，整节课全凭Grody的个人魅力支撑，但你不得不承认，这样的效果甚至超过了99%的正常设置的课程。每个人都喜欢他，我也不例外。感觉自己至少对leadership有了启蒙和清晰一点的概念，未来还有机会去实践，去再上他的课。最后一节课他讲了很多，分享了很多自己的故事，听君一席话，胜读十年书。一定要再请他Flunch！</p><p>周四晚上去教授家吃结课晚餐，教授家里真的很温馨，很有中产阶级的味道。十米长的拼成的餐桌，装饰华丽的圣诞树，在门口看起来有些吓人的圣诞老师模型我都是第一次见到。无限循环的圣诞歌曲，真的有了过节的氛围。但说实话，教授人非常好，但我在这门课上学到的东西确实不多，或者说自己认知范围内的提升不多。我室友的一句话说的很好，如果你已经当过一个公司的CEO再来听这门课，一定和现在的你有完全不同的收获。最后我们每个人发言做了一个相当于年终总结吧，我只能说自己有些许的言不由衷，因为确实没学到什么。但每个人都表现地很真诚，也就无所谓了。</p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20211207155621.png" alt="吓人的圣诞老人"></p><h2 id="喝酒"><a href="#喝酒" class="headerlink" title="喝酒"></a>喝酒</h2><p>当然不希望这成为我每次博客的小标题哈哈。但这周五喝酒，我是为了给朋友送行。他没有final考试，全都是paper，所以周六一早就回家了。我没有喝多少，朋友带的威士忌太甜了，不是我喜欢的纯烈味道。当然，最后也完完全全没有上次在纽约开心，原因就不说了。</p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20211207155656.png" alt="喝醉的朋友们"></p><h2 id="通宵"><a href="#通宵" class="headerlink" title="通宵"></a>通宵</h2><p>算是自己在duke的第一个通宵吧，比我想象中的晚太多了。甚至这一次熬通宵都不是必须的。图书馆在final这一周终于成了通宵开门，我周六晚上一个人在地下室赶paper，没有任何一个人在图书馆。有一种梦回去年同一个时候，熬夜写文书的日子，但这一回内心是莫名的自信与充满希望。从图书馆出来，已经是将近五点了，写完paper，发给同学，完成诺言的感觉真的很棒。</p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20211207155732.png" alt="凌晨四点半的East Campus"></p><h2 id="换个地方自习"><a href="#换个地方自习" class="headerlink" title="换个地方自习"></a>换个地方自习</h2><p>这可能是我最开心的一天了。</p><p>坐在一个酷似农家乐的庭院里，写着paper，朋友们都坐在身边，这个感觉太棒了。尤其是还能帮助朋友的中文学习，终于终于感受到自己能够帮助到别人了。非常享受这里的氛围，和朋友们random的对话，非常惬意。希望还有机会。</p><div class="justified-gallery"><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20211207155808.png" alt="和朋友们一起学习"><br><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20211207155849.png" alt="竹林庭院"><br><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20211207155924.png" alt="算是教大家中文吧哈哈"><br><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20211207155954.png" alt="有内涵的中文书"></p></div><h2 id="火警"><a href="#火警" class="headerlink" title="火警"></a>火警</h2><p>期末了，也终于轮到我们East House触发火警了，警铃非常刺耳，所有人在凌晨一点走出建筑物，我穿着短袖短裤和大家攀谈了开来。不到10分钟，消防车就来了。红闪闪的颇有过节的气氛，大家还在拍照留念，我也不例外。最后当然是什么也没有发现，据说是因为水系统的问题出触发了火警。</p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20211207160021.png" alt="消防车停在宿舍门前"></p><p>最后一周了，后天一场数学final，加油！</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>最最最后一天了，现在正坐在从纽约飞往durham的飞机上，刚刚飞过繁华的曼哈顿上空，我甚至能够清楚地看到布鲁克林大桥、自由女神像。是时候做个总结了。</p><span id="more"></span><h2 id="今天"><a href="#今天" class="headerlink" title="今天"></a>今天</h2><p>今天是什么都没有干，昨晚参观完911纪念馆，一晚上都沉迷于知乎的各种911专栏，意外刷到了烧焦的尸体的照片，我确实被吓到了，直到凌晨四点多我才睡着。早上起来后，整理好行李，买的各种衣服打包好到就近的快递站投递了，30刀，确实比我想象中的贵。之后到中国超市买了一大堆零食，送给朋友。</p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20211130000151.png" alt="朋友家旁边的西安名吃，不正宗但是好吃"></p><h2 id="朋友"><a href="#朋友" class="headerlink" title="朋友"></a>朋友</h2><p>能够来纽约，多亏了我的朋友。当时我也没多想，微信里他回“来！”，我就立马订了机票，果断决策。来这里之后，也为他添了不少麻烦，蹭吃蹭住加陪玩，我着实是有些不好意思。我最大的感受是他活得很真实，令人羡慕的那种真实，对自己感受的真实对待，对自己目标的认真对待，还有对朋友的真心真实对待，我深有感触。</p><p>他带我逛了大都会艺术博物馆，帝国大厦……这些震撼的景色，事物我可能一辈子都不会忘记，甚至我承诺还会再来一遍。我也会记住，第一次开眼界是在他的带领下。他攒了局，让我认识了新老朋友，喝酒吃烤肉，是我最快乐的时光。他的前途一路光明，我衷心祝福。</p><p>很多话，尽在不言中。我会一直记得酒后说的那些话，我们觥筹交错之间的你来我往的对话，十年后就是我们站在曼哈顿至高点的谈资。</p><p>今晚在纽约的最后一顿是麻辣烫，我甚至在国内都没有怎么吃过。但这顿饭确实好吃，回到学校后再也不可能吃到如此美味的传统中餐了。之后我们一起坐地铁回家，我终于碰上了地铁车厢里的卖唱，说实话还是蛮好听的。只是我还未来得及拿出钱包，他就下车了。</p><p>到家之后，拿好行李，他送我去地铁站。等了快15分钟，M列车来了两趟，却始终没有我要乘坐的E。也许上帝也知道我还想多探索探索纽约吧。朋友站在我旁边，我一直在想当列车驶来，我们会以怎样的形式告别，是拥抱还是握手还是口头再见。我们的15分钟，几乎是在沉默中度过的，我们知道一切尽在不言中。</p><p>列车来了，挤满了乘客。这是我见过最拥挤的纽约地铁了，没想到是在最后一程遇见了。人很多，他说“快挤，待会儿挤不上了”。我和他握了握手，抓着行李箱就上了地铁。列车开动时，我看到他从窗户外给我打招呼，我也向他告别。</p><p>当时我似乎没有任何热烈的情感，没有任何的怀念与惋惜，只是平平淡淡地，就像车平平淡淡地开走了一样。但我知道，君子之交淡如水，这份友谊会长存。</p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20211130000358.png" alt="与朋友在曼哈顿最高观景平台上"></p><h2 id="城市的感觉"><a href="#城市的感觉" class="headerlink" title="城市的感觉"></a>城市的感觉</h2><p>我喜欢这座城市，远超我的期待。城市生活节奏很快，很压抑，人人都是快速行走，不想给自己找麻烦，朋友家公寓的电梯让我坐出了跳楼机的感觉，快快快，时间就是金钱。但我是游客，一个特立独行的存在，慢与快的碰撞，让我有机会观察每一个纽约客，每一节地铁车厢里的百态众生，第五大道上人们的笑容和面孔。我爱四处张望，尽可能多的去感受这座城市。</p><p>帝国大厦之巅，我见证了真正的世界城的繁华。大都会博物馆的玻璃展厅，我见识了美国历史文化的强大和世界文明之国的霸道。911纪念馆，我感受到了城市脆弱的一面，铭记历史的心。</p><p>这里其实更像中国的城市，相似的生活方式。</p><p>有机会，还来。与她一起。</p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20211130000240.png" alt="JFK机场Terminal 5的标语"></p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>今天算是在纽约最后完整的一天了，明晚就要坐飞机离开了。今天也是感恩节假期的最后一天，这个我从两周前就开始期待的假期，无以言说的圆满。从序幕到进行时到临近尾声，我感恩遇到的一切新朋友，老朋友，遇见的新事物，旧事物。</p><span id="more"></span><h2 id="911-Memorial-amp-Meseum"><a href="#911-Memorial-amp-Meseum" class="headerlink" title="911 Memorial &amp; Meseum"></a>911 Memorial &amp; Meseum</h2><p>起床已经是中午了，其实来纽约的每一天早上都会睡到自然醒，也是唯一一次旅行每天睡到自然醒。朋友亲手做的中午饭，虽然只是简简单单的烤面包煎鸡蛋，我却真的感觉这是我吃过的最好的brunch了。</p><p>之后坐地铁前往911纪念馆。自己上一次来纽约，坐车时路过大水池，这个画面一直印刻在我的脑子里，这次也算是弥补没有下车参观911纪念馆的遗憾了。和大多数人一样，摩天大楼对我有着天然的吸引力，于我而言摩天大楼就是人类奇迹。从设计到施工到投入使用，都是超越人类工程极限的挑战。记得第一次去的高楼大厦是台北101，我印象最深的不是高空的观景台，我甚至已经记不清是否有观景台，也不是当时亚洲最大的阻尼器，而是101广场上镌刻的因为修建台北101大楼意外去世的建筑工人们。我热衷于摩天大楼，却又尤其害怕看到因为挑战极限而丧生的人们。对于世贸大厦，我是一样的感觉，所以这是我必去的地方，尽管他不是那么有趣，甚至有些压抑。<br>站在水池的边上，你能深刻地体会到那种悲壮和肃穆，瀑布喷涌直下，水池底部黑暗深邃。水池的一圈镌刻着所有遇难者的名字，历久弥新。为了表示尊重和哀悼，我绕着水池走了整整一圈，还特别关注有没有中国人的名字。当真的找到的时候，内心还是隐隐作痛。令我比较愧疚的是，我们当时居然以为只有一个水池，刚刚查gogole才发现有两个水池，而他们近在咫尺。确实是我的疏忽，亦或许是被其中一个水池吸引住了，周遭的一切包括高楼大厦都没有那么突出了。<br>排队进入911纪念馆，馆内面积非常大，而且没有明显的布局格局，我们甚至被绕晕了。但是还是能被每一个看过的地方所震撼，从目击者的语音备忘录，到当时曼哈顿目击者惊愕表情的照片轮播，到一条延伸整面墙的时间轴和事件，我仿佛真的身处911当天。<br><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20211129000924.png"><br>那份绝望，我觉得没有人能承受。我看到了飞机硬生生直接撞击北塔的照片，南塔在燃烧59分钟后如此庞然大物轰然倒塌的视频，这简直就是世界末日。<br><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20211129001128.png"><br><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20211129000951.png"><br>被压扁的消防车，生存者阶梯，残留的钢架结构，难以想象2001年这里发生的如此悲剧。同时，感慨美国这个国家的resilience，在如此的末日之后能够恢复，现在的纽约更加繁华，更加使人向往。911的阴霾早已散去，但越来越多的人会记住，哪怕是像我们一样事件发生时还未出生的人们。这是人类共同的悲剧，我们一同缅怀一同怀念一同成长。</p><div class="justified-gallery"><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20211129001014.png"><br><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20211129001030.png"><br><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20211129000836.png"><br><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20211129001045.png"><br><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20211129001106.png"><br><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20211129001155.png"></p></div><h2 id="华尔街-amp-纽约证券交易所"><a href="#华尔街-amp-纽约证券交易所" class="headerlink" title="华尔街 &amp; 纽约证券交易所"></a>华尔街 &amp; 纽约证券交易所</h2><p>这是上次就来过的地方，而上回为数不多保留下来的照片里，纽交所就是其中一张。我想着能够拍一张一模一样的照片，也算是见证了自己的成长和人生轨迹的重大转变，毕竟自己之前从未想过本科来到美国留学，也从未想过自己会以本科大一留学生的身份再次来到这个6年前来到过的地方，再拍一张照片。尽管季节不同，建筑物上的装饰物不知早已换了数千次，但人是同一个人，梦想是同一个梦想。</p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20211129001940.png" alt="November 2021"><br><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/IMG_2757_Original.jpg" alt="August 2015"><br>同时又来到了记忆中的牛这里，拍了一张游客照。说实话我不喜欢金融，以我肤浅的认识，我认为金融太过于虚拟，股掌之间有人倾家荡产有人赚的盆满钵满。</p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20211129001230.png"></p><h2 id="唐人街"><a href="#唐人街" class="headerlink" title="唐人街"></a>唐人街</h2><p>这里，真的就是中国。你看到全部都是中文的店名，真的就像是回家了。还有传统的挂满街道的灯笼，甚至chase都成了“大通银行”，真的有一种回到中国的错觉。本来要买甜品的店关门了，我们也只是稍作停留就坐地铁走了。</p><p>这里真的让我感觉到了纽约的包容，也让我感受到了美国各地巨大的差异，美国是一个一切皆有可能的地方。就像我的学校杜克所在地一样，田野，林间，开车20分钟才有的一家小小的中餐，但却有一所大学，有一群和纽约完全不一样的美国人，真的折服于这个国家这种随机的魅力。</p><div class="justified-gallery"><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20211129001247.png"><br><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20211129001303.png"><br><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20211129001333.png"></p></div><h2 id="再相聚-amp-Edge-Sky-Deck-at-Hudson-Yard"><a href="#再相聚-amp-Edge-Sky-Deck-at-Hudson-Yard" class="headerlink" title="再相聚 &amp; Edge Sky Deck at Hudson Yard"></a>再相聚 &amp; Edge Sky Deck at Hudson Yard</h2><p>之后我们去了k-town，韩国城，和同样在纽约的两个高中同学聚一聚。再次见面，真的有种不真实感，就像是重回高中一样，大家还是一样的开玩笑，还是一样的感觉。我感觉他们人都没有变，一样的性格，一样的一切，我为他们感到高兴。我为自己能够和他们在家乡万里之外再相聚感到无比的感恩。</p><p>吃完非常好吃的韩国烤肉，（就像是我在中国西安赛格吃到的韩国烤肉一样好吃）我们坐地铁去Hudson河畔新建好的摩天大楼Edge参观。真的超乎我的想象，户外观景台是全透明的观景玻璃，向外倾斜。超过三分之二的纽约曼哈顿尽收眼底。能够同时看到曼哈顿，Hudson river还有new jersey。但说实话虽然没有了像帝国大厦一样的铁丝网遮挡风景，但我仍感觉帝国大厦是最让我震撼的，或许是当时正赶上日落时分，又或许是第一次的新鲜感。但是，edge也是绝佳的风景，必去的景点。</p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20211129001356.png"></p><p>我们四个人正在合影的时候，在全透明的地面玻璃上，有人求婚了！这是我第一次真的亲身经历有人在公共场合求婚，虽然影视作品里看了无数，但仍是十分激动。男生单膝跪地，脚下就是透明的繁华的纽约城，女生显然是幸福感爆棚。大家爆发出热烈的掌声和欢呼声，我也真心祝福他们，为他们感到开心，尽管我们是素未谋面的陌生人，我甚至在夜晚黑暗中没有看清他们的面庞，但这些都不重要，重要的是他们有机会在纽约最高观景台体验人生如此重要的一刻，我很羡慕。之后我们坐在观景台的一个向上的阶梯上，俯瞰整个曼哈顿夜景，朋友说“下次一定不要一个人来”，确实下次死也不要一个人来，如此美景，需要和你爱的人，爱你的人分享。甚至如此美景并不重要，重要的是看到如此美景让你爱的人开心，让如此美景成为你们共同的美好回忆。</p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20211129001635.png"></p><p>人都是喜欢寄托情感的。虽说比以前更习惯孤独了，但随着年龄的到来，对爱情的渴望愈来愈深，希望我能尽早勇敢地迈出第一步，找到属于我的那份美好吧。</p><div class="justified-gallery"><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20211129001449.png"><br><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20211129001527.png"><br><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20211129001601.png"><br><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20211129001617.png"><br><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20211129001659.png"></p></div><p>祝好。</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>出人意料，这是我第一次觉得旅游的时光过的好慢，每天都游历了无数，结识了无数，感悟了无数。今天是第三天，也是想对来说较平淡的一天，却也是有额外的小确幸。</p><span id="more"></span><h2 id="酒后"><a href="#酒后" class="headerlink" title="酒后"></a>酒后</h2><p>继续喝醉的故事，奇怪的是，喝醉之后我一晚上没有睡着，或者说我潜意识认为自己没有睡着。早上六七点就完全醒了，再也睡不着了。想起昨晚的荒唐事，真的和hang over的剧情如出一辙，忍不住傻笑起来。一个朋友光着上身，头埋在垃圾桶里吐了一晚上然后睡着了；另一个朋友躺在浴缸里睡着了，之后迷迷糊糊地趴在地上睡着了。早上起来找不到证件，果真在浴缸里。荒唐荒唐，难得难得，开心开心。早上收拾一片狼藉的房间，好奇闻了一下昨晚喝的酒，呕吐感瞬间就来了。酒真的不好喝，酒醉后说的胡话，经历确实让人上瘾。</p><h2 id="圣帕特里克大教堂"><a href="#圣帕特里克大教堂" class="headerlink" title="圣帕特里克大教堂"></a>圣帕特里克大教堂</h2><p>接着睡，又是迷迷糊糊地睡到了中午12点。吃了饭，下午开始自己探索纽约。说实话，这是我人生第一次自己探索一个城市，我甚至没有一个人探索过自己的家乡。我自认为是一个非常害怕孤独的人，但大学教给我的最重要的一件事情之一就是接纳孤独，学会孤独。同理，独行旅行也是别样的感觉。整理好行装，我坐上地铁，前往圣帕特里克大教堂。自己六年前潦潦草草经过过这里，但我甚至记不清是否进去过。街角处，偌大的教堂瞬现，比记忆中的，想象中的雄伟壮观。不远处有一个车队，声浪巨大，车队悬挂着不知道是代表着什么的旗帜，我努力扭过头想一探究竟，可距离仍不足以让我分辨清楚。只记得这又一次应证了纽约的疯狂，任何人任何事，在这里都有可能。<br>进入教堂，没有整个外观带给我得震撼，却也是我见过的最大的教堂了。正好赶上应该是唱诗班在合唱，非常多的人站在座位前，非常虔诚地在听。我绕着教堂走了一圈，两边的类似浮雕一样的地方都仔仔细细地逛了一遍。中途我也走到座位前，尝试用心去聆听唱诗班，去感受如此神圣化，虔诚的这样一个时刻。唱诗班结束之后，我正好走到了最前排，发现很多人是跪在专门的枕木上，虔诚无比。还有的人像是跋涉千里特地而来，与应该是教堂的人员握手交谈，我又一次感受到了他们由心而发的那种虔诚。<br>往回转圈的时候，我才注意到可以两美元点亮神前的蜡烛，就像去寺庙烧香一样。我便捐了两美元，尝试去点燃一个蜡烛。这才发现所有蜡烛都是点燃了的，需要自己从左手的桶里取新的蜡烛。于是，我取出新的蜡烛，放到格子上，拿起木条去引火。结果蜡烛的引火线太歪了，我第一次没有成功。我扯了扯线，又试了一遍，终于点亮了。我在想为什么自己要去点亮，可能是想到了makenew的朋友们，虽然我目前不相信god，但我相信这群难得的朋友，我愿意为他们去点亮。我甚至没有想去祈祷什么，去忏悔什么，甚至可以说是下意识地就点亮了。当然我也知道自己不够虔诚，这或许就是第一次没有点亮成功的原因吧。但还是很开心，毕竟是人生第一次在教堂里点亮了一些东西，人生中有一些情感和人事物是和教堂有联系的。</p><div class="justified-gallery"><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20211127232903.png"><br><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20211127233859.png"><br><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20211127233914.png"><br><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20211127233928.png"><br><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20211127233946.png"></p></div><h2 id="LEGO-NYC"><a href="#LEGO-NYC" class="headerlink" title="LEGO NYC"></a>LEGO NYC</h2><p>乐高就在大教堂的对面，排队整整延伸了100多米。等了快20分钟，终于进来了。第一个引入眼帘的就是乐高打字机，某一瞬间我甚至说服自己需要买一个，299美元也不算是很贵，当然最后理性还是战胜了瞬间的冲动。上了楼，发现了一个好玩的东西，可以自己设计乐高小人，只是付款的时候才知道三个乐高小人36美金，真的就是黄金做的乐高小人。设计的过程还算是有趣，我购买了三个，分别送给三个朋友。有一些设计我是真的用心了，当然我也对于自己的艺术水平有理性的认知，只是希望他们喜欢，这个黄金乐高小人。<br>之后无意间瞥见了一个跑车积木，看了看价格，能接受，甚至没有任何犹豫就拿起来去结账了。自己此前问了店员，我本是想去买和F1有关的跑车积木的，但店员把我领到了一楼让我看了看数百刀的布加迪和兰博基尼，我就知道这里没有F1了。当然，最后能够抱着一个跑车和三个小人离开，也算是很开心了。</p><div class="justified-gallery"><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20211127234252.png"><br><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20211127234935.png"></p></div><h2 id="Shopping"><a href="#Shopping" class="headerlink" title="Shopping"></a>Shopping</h2><p>之后去了Nike和Adidas，因为感恩节，分别打85折和6折，所有商品。在Nike我买了一双鞋，在Adidas买了一件羽绒服还有几条裤子。说实话，这是我第一次给自己正式地买衣服，平常都是母亲给我买好了一切的一切，而我自己对于衣服鞋子也没有任何要求和我至今仍无法理解的追求潮流的思想。就算去旅行，我也只是懒得试穿，买几件短袖了事。这是我第一回，真真正正试了好久鞋和衣服，连店员都不耐烦了，开玩笑说”Hope to see you tomorrow bro”。但我是非常开心的，这真的是自己照顾自己的开始，自爱的开始。我开始不会将就鞋大了一点，而是找店员一个尺码一个尺码地换与试穿。我喜欢这样的自己，我开始照顾自己了。<br>回去的路上，第五大道热闹非凡，百老汇的墙面上正上演着美轮美奂的灯光秀，无数的观众驻足欣赏，这种热热闹闹的感觉，很温暖。当然，又路过了微软。</p><div class="justified-gallery"><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20211128000223.png"><br><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20211128000207.png"><br><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20211128000239.png"><br><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20211128000257.png"><br><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20211128000339.png"></p></div><h2 id="晚饭"><a href="#晚饭" class="headerlink" title="晚饭"></a>晚饭</h2><p>回到家，朋友煮了螺蛳粉。又是一个第一次，人生第一次吃螺蛳粉。很臭，很好吃。吃完饭，感觉到了久违的空虚。今晚，没有朋友喝酒聚会，没有在第五大道夜游，我开始有点想念在durham的乡村生活，至少每个晚上我有室友，有舍友，有makenew的朋友们，有community。</p><p>今晚确实无聊，祝好。</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>真的太开心了，感觉不可能比今天更开心了。现在应该是喝醉了，想着喝醉了写一篇博客也很特别的，于是在凌晨两点决定也写博客。我也不知道自己会说什么胡话。</p><span id="more"></span><h2 id="大都会艺术博物馆"><a href="#大都会艺术博物馆" class="headerlink" title="大都会艺术博物馆"></a>大都会艺术博物馆</h2><p>早上起来已是快12点了，第一站大都会艺术博物馆。博物馆门口有很多买热狗，买chicken stick的摊子，我们随便选了一些买了一个纽约经典的chicken stick还有另外一个摊的hot dog，坐在博物馆门口的阶梯上吃了起来。风愈来愈冷了，真的和脸上刀子割一样。然后我们排了大概20分钟的队，在寒风的洗礼中进入了大都会博物馆。首先进入了古埃及馆，平常在课本上才能看到的雕塑，此刻成十成百地陈列在我的面前，真的非常震撼。之后走进神庙展厅，一半的天空都是玻璃，我们开玩笑说：“美国人把人家祖先的家都完完整整地搬过来了”。真的佩服美国人对于人类文明历史的痴迷和珍藏。我这辈子没有见过如此之多的文物汇聚在一起。有时候真的觉得，我们中国人谴责美国人掠夺中国的文物，但想一想不是美国人，这些文物可能就不会保存到现在了，这样一想，我真的无比敬佩美国人对人类文明的敬畏和存续之心。<br>之后我们甚至到了苏州园林的展厅，实话实说，某一瞬间我真心觉得自己深处苏州，在小桥流水之间游历园林万般美景。asian art最震撼我的，还有占满整面十米多长墙面的药佛画册，坐在日月光佛面前，别是一般感悟。</p><p>总的感悟就是大都会博物馆真的是一个无谓俗人或事艺术家，都能够享受艺术带给人或直接或间接的冲击性美感。绝对值得一逛，不需要任何攻略，随着心而走。</p><div class="justified-gallery"><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20211127022211.png"><br><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20211127024055.png"><br><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20211127024120.png"><br><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20211127024141.png"><br><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20211127024225.png"><br><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20211127024436.png"></p></div><h2 id="帝国大厦"><a href="#帝国大厦" class="headerlink" title="帝国大厦"></a>帝国大厦</h2><p>这是我见过最震撼的场景了，现代场景，没有之一。</p><p>撑着观光电梯，到达室外观景平台，正好赶上日落。真的被如此美的景色所震撼，这辈子可能都不会见到如此美好的景象了。一盏盏远处的霓虹灯，或许是机场，或许是住宅楼，或许是办公楼，万盏一起汇成了魅力无穷的纽约市。站在观景平台，风无情地刮着，内心的震惊&#96;之情无法控制地倾泻着，这可能就是纽约的魅力吧。或许只有现代的人类才能领略这现代文明创造的伟大奇迹吧，我并不觉得纽约是比兵马俑小的一个奇迹，相反，我觉得这是现代人最能领略的东西，就像可能古代人无法领略都市美景一样。</p><p>站在观景平台，一动不动，都是一种享受。未来，希望有栋楼可以是我的。</p><div class="justified-gallery"><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20211127024619.png"><br><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20211127024656.png"><br><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20211127024537.png"><br><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20211127024716.png"><br><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20211127024801.png"><br><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20211127031305.png"></p></div><h2 id="第五大道-微软和苹果"><a href="#第五大道-微软和苹果" class="headerlink" title="第五大道 微软和苹果"></a>第五大道 微软和苹果</h2><p>这里真的是心心念念的地方了。犹记得6年前来这里的苹果店买了人生第一台iphone，然后再欧着大巴看着微软的标志但是错过了，今天终于有机会圆梦了。第一个进的店就是微软。说是话没有我想象的好，店员对微软的热爱程度甚至不及我，当然可能也是我本来就没有任何产品购买需求，但毕竟是为数不多的微软仍在运营的全球旗舰店，我把三层全部逛了一遍才离开，最后也很开心能够和店员照了一张合影。看到了梦寐以求的surface laptop studio,surface duo还有surface earbuds，很是开心。<br>之后，顺便，又去了五年前买iphone 6的苹果店，在门口穿着微软的衣服拍了一张打苹果logo的照片，进了店里之后又在纠结万分之后买了一个镌刻“Microsoft”的airpods pro，怎么说，也算是很讽刺或者很搞笑吧。<br>不得不说，苹果的环境就给人一种想要购买的冲动的欲望。不得不说，微软在消费者领域离苹果还差的很多。</p><div class="justified-gallery"><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20211127025316.png"><br><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20211127025443.png"><br><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20211127025459.png"><br><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20211127025520.png"><br><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20211127025539.png"><br><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20211127025600.png"><br><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20211127025616.png"></p></div><h2 id="西安人聚餐"><a href="#西安人聚餐" class="headerlink" title="西安人聚餐"></a>西安人聚餐</h2><p>回到家，买了心心念念的西安凉皮肉夹馍，真的是非常奇妙。离家乡万里之外，花着十倍的价钱，吃着并不正宗的凉皮肉夹馍，却也是非常感动。之后，和来自西安的一个朋友初识，一起打牌，一起喝酒，一起酒后吐真言，别是惬意。再后来，已是凌晨，又来了一位原籍深圳的北京人，畅谈甚欢。有人喝倒了，但我可能还算半醉半醒吧，趁着现在把博客写完，也是奇特的经历。我们谈笑风生，我一直以为帝国大厦可能就是今天的高潮了，没想到半夜十二点才是高潮，真他妈开心（请允许我不文明用语一处，这是自己第一次哪怕在生活中说脏话），只是无以言表此刻兴奋激动的心情。</p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20211127031125.png"></p><p>不知道明天早上的自己看到这条博客会是什么心情，总之，现在的我一点也不后悔！！！</p><p>各位晚安！！！</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>终于来到了心心念念的纽约，也算是一场说走就走的旅行了。尽管机票两周前早早地就订好了，但行李是在走的当天收拾的，也没有任何旅行计划，就想着一股脑先挤进这座世界城。</p><span id="more"></span><h2 id="前夜"><a href="#前夜" class="headerlink" title="前夜"></a>前夜</h2><p>本来预计昨晚10点半到纽约的航班，10点半才起飞，到纽约已是凌晨。虽说飞机延误了，但我却并没有像平常一般一样抱怨，或许是因为自己知道选的是最便宜的航班，降低期待是理应的。连飞机的显示屏也像是雪花屏一样，确实是年久失修。但令我感到意外的是，座椅间的宽度是我坐过最宽的经济舱，这一项很加分。</p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20211125222109.png"></p><p>降落的时候，我打开遮阳板，尽可能地侧着身子去透过靠身后的窗户俯瞰，和任何一个大城市一样，灯光璀璨。紧接着，我发现不远处有一架和我们保持在同一高度，闪着巡航灯的飞机。没想到我们两个航班同时降落！当飞机接地的那一刻，远处的小亮点也逐渐水平移动了起来，这种感觉妙不可言。同时，JFK机场之大也确实是通过这一特殊的经历真正体会到了。</p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20211125222309.png"></p><p>坐在从机场terminal 5到朋友家的uber上，带上耳机，循环播放Taylor Swift的Welcome to New York，心里很是激动。也不知道是经过哪一个桥的时候，正好对面能够看到曼哈顿的城市天际线，那一刻我真的被震撼了。或许是将近半年没有走进繁华城市，亦或是这就是纽约独特的魅力让人心驰神往，普普通通的楼我却也想拍照留念。</p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20211125223316.png"></p><p>“Welcome to New York~ It’s been waiting for you~”到了朋友家，已是凌晨一点。从高中毕业算起，也将近半年没有见面了，不能说一见如故，也是久违重逢之喜悦。我们互相交换了Duke和NYU的merchants，坐在沙发上相谈甚欢。谈天谈地，谈学校，谈生活，谈未来。</p><h2 id="6年前"><a href="#6年前" class="headerlink" title="6年前"></a>6年前</h2><p>六年前的那个暑假，去加拿大参加数学比赛，顺便来到纽约还有波士顿转了一圈。当时从多伦多飞纽约纽瓦克国际机场，而这回是JFK。这样来说，自己也是飞抵过2&#x2F;3的纽约机场了。旅游，我总是喜欢向自己炫耀一些没有意义的次数。当时拍了很多照片，留下来的却少之又少。我能找到的，只剩在纽交所，前往自由女神像的穿上，还有洛克菲勒中心拍的三张懵懵懂懂的照片。这次的一个愿望，就是希望能够在相同的地方拍一张一模一样的照片，相信会很有纪念意义吧。明天，或是后天，就去华尔街。</p><h2 id="地铁"><a href="#地铁" class="headerlink" title="地铁"></a>地铁</h2><p>纽约的地铁比我想象中的干净许多。甚至还有些超出预期。<br>办了一张32刀的周卡，出乎意料地薄，就像纸片一样，随随便便都能吹跑。我入站的口很小，三个闸机过后直接就是地铁隧道，相比国内层层叠叠的地铁站简单粗暴了不少。地铁驶来的时候，很快，总长度也很长。铁轨和平台没有任何格挡，想不开脑子一热跳下去谁也救不了。<br>进了车厢，看见有人躺在座位上睡觉，而且一看就是那种睡了一晚上的，裹得严严实实的，一动不动。地铁上真的是什么人都有。</p><div class="justified-gallery"><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20211125223436.png"><br><img

id="华盛顿广场公园"><a href="#华盛顿广场公园" class="headerlink" title="华盛顿广场公园"></a>华盛顿广场公园</h2><p>朋友说带我去他的学校nyu看一看，而最核心最著名的就是华盛顿公园。下了地铁，我们徒步走向公园，有很多黑人小贩在卖大麻，甚至整个广场中心都是买大麻的，我这个乡村学校来的学生确实是被震撼到了。<br>公园不大，却有很多椅子。上面甚至还标明了谁谁谁捐赠，致我爱的人之类的话，别有浪漫。我们坐在椅子上，看着人来人往，有用脚画水墨画卖艺的，有卖大麻的，有卖热狗的，有躺在草坪上睡觉的，还有在一个自己带来的平衡木上练舞蹈的。就像我的朋友说的一样，每天坐在这里，看来来往往的路人，就像看人间百态，别有一番风味。<br>由于今天是感恩节，这里人也不算多，我也没想到大都市纽约带给我的第一个感觉居然是静谧沉静。<br>接着我们简单参观了nyu的各个建筑，我只能感慨在大都市和乡村地区的学校生活体验真的大相径庭。我很幸运来了duke，在这样一个惬意的大片大片的校园里有一群狐朋狗友住在同一个宿舍，认识了很多很多的人。而我感觉我的朋友，来这里真的就像是开始工作了一样，独立性很强。</p><div class="justified-gallery"><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20211126103627.png"><br><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20211126103722.png"><br><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20211126103752.png"><br><img

id="高线公园"><a href="#高线公园" class="headerlink" title="高线公园"></a>高线公园</h2><p>接着我们去了高线公园，是由一条废弃的铁轨改建而来的。就像是硬从寸土寸金的大都市挤出了一个云中走廊，反差感明显。走在旧时的铁轨上，两边有很多延伸出去的观景平台，我痴迷于置身于高楼大厦之间，仿佛道路只是为了隔开建筑物而不是为了通行一样，我喜欢这种局促感。我们走到了hudson河边，走到了一个非常壮观的前卫的艺术品前，拍了拍照便赶往吃饭了。<br>纽约果然是有很多好吃的，包括中餐。由于是感恩节，各个都要排队两小时以上。我们最后选择了一家稍贵但也是非常好吃的一家。我吃了很多很多。很满足。</p><div class="justified-gallery"><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20211126103925.png"><br><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20211126104008.png"><br><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20211126104037.png"><br><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20211126104104.png"></p></div><h2 id="时代广场"><a href="#时代广场" class="headerlink" title="时代广场"></a>时代广场</h2><p>酒足饭饱，天也早早黑了下来，我们坐地铁前往时代广场。一出地铁口，还在登阶梯的时候，就被巨大的动态广告牌所吸引，就像是井底之蛙一样。<br>来到时代广场的核心，人山人海。我试图回忆上一次来这里的情景，却怎么也联系不起来和现在的场景。以我模糊的记忆，我感觉时代广场没有记忆里的那次那么喧嚣了，那么壮观了，就像是一个大型世界版的南京步行街一样，而事实也是如此。但当你看着形形色色各种皮肤各种面孔说着各种话的人与你摩肩接踵地相遇时，就会感慨纽约真的是一个地球村。</p><div class="justified-gallery"><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20211126104210.png"><br><img

River河畔</h2><p>晚上，我们骑着自行车来到east river河畔，对面就是整个曼哈顿。那种现代都市楼宇纵横灯光点缀的美，无以言语。整个城市群从这边延伸到远远的另一边，你看不到尽头。朋友说“你以为你喜欢的事纽约，其实你喜欢的只是曼哈顿而已”。事实也确实如此。<br>坐在河边的椅子上，看着繁华无比的对岸，甚至恍惚间查了地图才发现正对岸就是联合国总部，只是有一种不真实感，像是在拍电影。人类野蛮生长，诞生了纽约这样一个现代文明奇迹与结晶。</p><div

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>下周就是感恩节了，悸动的心却从这周就开始了。不知是不是太过激动，这一周居然失眠了。躺在床上翻来覆去，却怎么也睡不着。<span id="more"></span>睡眠一直是我自己从不担心的，无论在哪里，我总能很快地入睡。这周却很是反常，每天都辗转反侧到凌晨两三点钟。第二天也是无精打采，甚至旷过了早上10点的计算机课，当然还是准时爬起来坐在宿舍里看直播。</p><h2 id="F1史上第一位中国车手"><a href="#F1史上第一位中国车手" class="headerlink" title="F1史上第一位中国车手"></a>F1史上第一位中国车手</h2><p>F1下一个赛季终于要迎来历史上第一个中国车手了。这对于中国赛车运动来说是毋庸置疑的一大里程碑。刷到官宣的ins时我感受到了久违的激动，现在回想起来这是我第一次对一项体育运动如此投入。其实自己也才是这个暑假才入坑F1，但很快便被瞬息万变的围场迷住了。对比而言，我可能是为数不多的作为体育大校Duke的大一新生，到现在为止一场篮球赛都没有看过，着实还有些惭愧。但确实自己对直接身体对抗的运动怎么也提不起兴趣。喜欢F1的人类与机械的终极配合，喜欢F1的场上场下的博弈，喜欢F1是一个奇迹频发的地方。<br>说句听起来自大的话，也或许是巧合，2015年我刚刚开始喜欢上微软，正好赶上微软新任CEO上台，也正是微软力挽狂澜的节点，直至现在成为世界市值最高的公司。现在又喜欢上F1，然后正好赶上了中国车手进军的黄金时代。</p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20211122020055.png"></p><h2 id="质疑"><a href="#质疑" class="headerlink" title="质疑"></a>质疑</h2><p>上了大学，明显感觉自己开始质疑很多人、事、物，情不自禁地质疑。有些质疑随着深入的探索消失了，有些却更加强烈。起初刚上MMS的课，我质疑每天阅读这些所谓Leadership的Harvard Business Review究竟有什么用，我更相信Leadership是一个实践科学。但随着不断地阅读，上课讨论，Grody总结，潜移默化地就能够讲一些很核心和意象的东西深深刻在脑子里，Leadership也在脑子里不断地形象化，开始去内化阅读的文章，课堂的讨论。<br>当然，也有质疑越来越深的。IE的seminar着实让我质疑得痛苦不堪。起初我是相信并且愿意做一些事情去推动climate change的，但未曾想到仅仅只是去组织一些无关痛痒的校园活动去combat climate disinformation。说句不好听的，校园里每天24小时灯火通明，我们就不能少开几个小时灯作为环保的措施吗？课上讨论的也是一些很虚的话题，我甚至越来越痛恨climate change，因为每节课都在反反复复地提到，却没有加深我对climate change的哪怕一点点了解。还有就是明显能看出来讨论的时候，很多人都只是信手拈来，在没有完全了解的基础上就开始胡诌，这是我非常不欣赏的。关键是教授也没有给出一些建设性的意见，更多的仅仅只是附和。这门课几乎没有知识输入，却让我们不停地观点产出。当然，有机会上这门课也是件好事，至少以后不会再去考虑social enterprise或是一些很浮于表面的社会活动。<br>同样开始质疑的，还有我的未来。惭愧的说，我感觉越成长，我越丧失了小时候对未来的野心和抱负。我在质疑，如果当一个微软的software engineer已经能够赚足够的钱，还能保持很好的work-life balance，我为什么不去这么做呢？更高更远的目标我真的可以实现吗，我真的还想去实现吗。我来duke如果只是想成为一个software engineer会不会太可惜了。但现阶段，自己接触身边的朋友，我感觉他们生活很开心，很惬意，从某种意义上这不就是我想要的生活吗。一年前在文书里写到了Make social impact的那个人还是我吗？</p><h2 id="不怀念"><a href="#不怀念" class="headerlink" title="不怀念"></a>不怀念</h2><p>和朋友谈论起是否想念自己的家人，总是很羞愧，因为我至少到目前为止真的没有思念过家人。Diego说他也不思念，一年不见甚至也不思念，他只是单纯地享受在这里和朋友的时光。而我感觉可能下个学期的某个时间点就会想念了，只是时候未到。希望我是对的。<br>同样，我不怀念以前的生活，我不怀念高中生活，我不怀念初中还有很远很远的以前。并不是说之前的生活并不精彩，只是和想念家人一样，平常的生活里完全想不到这些话题，这些人、事、物。</p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20211122020136.png"></p><h2 id="感恩节火鸡"><a href="#感恩节火鸡" class="headerlink" title="感恩节火鸡"></a>感恩节火鸡</h2><p>这真的是我过的第一个感恩节，周六在makenew吃了人生第一只火鸡。有时候觉得自己真的非常幸运能够遇到makenew，这里真的让我感觉像家。我感觉未来的日子里不会有比这次更好吃的火鸡了。真的没有想到自己的第一个感恩节过的就如此的开心。</p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20211122020214.png"></p><h2 id="不要照片"><a href="#不要照片" class="headerlink" title="不要照片"></a>不要照片</h2><p>最近发现生活需要用图片记录的意义逐渐没有了，做越是享受的事情，越想不起来要拍张照留念，而更愿意去感受每一秒钟的美好。然后事后用文字把这种体验美好的感觉记录下来。</p><p>确实很晚了，眼睛也开始打架了。这周不知为何多了这么多想要分享的内容。</p><p>祝好。</p>]]></content>
