    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>离我们的驻地Moab小镇10分钟车程，便是以各种自然拱门而闻名的Arches National Park。</p><span id="more"></span><h2 id="Page小镇"><a href="#Page小镇" class="headerlink" title="Page小镇"></a>Page小镇</h2><p>昨晚从canyonlands参观完之后开车一个小时便到达了Moab小镇。整个小镇的旅游氛围很浓，毕竟是依傍周围两个著名的National Parks所建。整个小镇遍布各式各样的餐厅还有纪念品商店。不得不说在这里买纪念品确实比在园区内的Visitor Center购买方便实惠了很多。我们一行人绕着三四家纪念品店转了有足足两个小时，当然最后也心满意足地买到了超值的打折商品。我一直有收藏冰箱贴的习惯，每每到访一个地方，都会尽可能买一个冰箱贴，回到学校之后再贴在宿舍的冰箱上，也算是记录自己的足迹的一种方式。</p><h2 id="看日出"><a href="#看日出" class="headerlink" title="看日出"></a>看日出</h2><p>看日出，确实需要提前一个小时。从一片漆黑，到东方鱼肚白，到朝霞万千，再到阳光普照，只有提前早早到达观景点才能够把整个过程完美地感受到。不争气的云朵虽然挡住了日出，但我们也捕捉到了很震撼的日出画面，尤其是天刚蒙蒙亮的时候。</p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image@master/2023/202303260237314.jpeg" alt="色彩分层"></p><p>另一个时间点是太阳已经升起来之后，金光照射在形态各异的巨石上，犹如金山。</p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image@master/2023/202303260249415.jpeg" alt="站在光与暗的分界线"></p><p>看日出的时候，我们遇见了一个老爷爷。他一个人坐在车里，我们刚到时便主动与我们寒暄。他说自己在这里已经一个多月了，每天都有走不完的trail和看不完的美景，着实令我非常羡慕。同时，老爷爷也说自己在这里是为了证实一个“理论”。他拍摄了很多镜头直对太阳的照片，由于反射而导致的光晕各种各样，而他认为那些光晕是外星人的足迹。他还给我展示了一些光晕和麦田怪圈的高度相似性。当然，我也就当轶事听过罢了。但再仔细想想，一个人能够为了自己相信的东西驱车数千里去寻找证据，我也很佩服。一是因为害怕，而是因为不想反驳，最终我只能不断以惊讶的语气附和结束了这段谈话。这也是一个很有趣的遭遇了。</p><h2 id="Hiking"><a href="#Hiking" class="headerlink" title="Hiking"></a>Hiking</h2><p>今天有很多hiking，但每一个都不是很长。最长的是最开始去Dedicate Arch，需要爬上爬下，但最后到达终点看到这独一无二的Arch也是非常值得。再一次感叹大自然的鬼斧神工。</p><h3 id="Dedicate-Arch"><a href="#Dedicate-Arch" class="headerlink" title="Dedicate Arch"></a>Dedicate Arch</h3><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image@master/2023/202303260257180.jpeg" alt="在巨大的Arch面前，我跳跃起来并不明显"></p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image@master/2023/202303260258117.jpeg" alt="The Arch in an arch"></p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image@master/2023/202303260259963.jpeg" alt="仔细看的话，你甚至能够发现3个arches"></p><h3 id="Double-Arch"><a href="#Double-Arch" class="headerlink" title="Double Arch"></a>Double Arch</h3><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image@master/2023/202303260300930.jpeg" alt="无比壮观的Double Arch"></p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image@master/2023/202303260302584.jpeg" alt="为了爬到这个位置，也是做足了心理准备"></p><h3 id="Balanced-Rock"><a href="#Balanced-Rock" class="headerlink" title="Balanced Rock"></a>Balanced Rock</h3><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image@master/2023/202303260303405.jpeg" alt="不知道这个石头还能在这里停留多久"></p><h2 id="深夜驱车"><a href="#深夜驱车" class="headerlink" title="深夜驱车"></a>深夜驱车</h2><p>晚上，我们开车前往Arizona的Monument Valley，和之前非常流行的益智游戏纪念碑谷同名。事实证明，这里的景色比游戏里的动画构图还要美轮美奂。</p><p>当然，该发生的时候终于发生了。我收到了人生第一张speeding ticket。伸手不见五指的晚上，我们在一个小镇的加油站刚出来，我一脚油门提速便被警察叔叔盯上了。直到我注意到后视镜里有非常刺眼的警车灯在闪烁，便立即路边停车，拿出驾照，双手放在方向盘上。总之，还有点莫名的开心，毕竟也算是一个人生第一次了，当然超速行为是坚决不可取的，也算是给自己了一个教训。我遇到的警官还是非常友好的，拿了我的驾照便回到警车开罚单了。之后一切处理妥当，耐心告诉我如何交罚款还有上诉，便放我们走了。那个晚上，是我唯一一次没有压着限速开车。</p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image@master/2023/202303260309015.jpeg" alt="警车灯闪烁"></p><h2 id="总结"><a href="#总结" class="headerlink" title="总结"></a>总结</h2><p>Arches能给人以很大的视觉冲击力，各式各样的arch遍布整个园区。当然，感觉最主要的几个景点都打卡一遍，也没有下次再来的必要了，也许可以透过Arch的角度再看一次日出或者日落！</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>转眼间已经20岁了。</p><span id="more"></span><p>春假的第一天，也是自己20岁的生日过后的第一天，也是自己能够合法在大租车行租车的第一天，我便踏上了旅行的第一程，也算是给自己一份特别的生日礼物吧。</p><h2 id="奔赴目的地"><a href="#奔赴目的地" class="headerlink" title="奔赴目的地"></a>奔赴目的地</h2><p>我们乘着RDU最早一班的直飞航班抵达了LAS Vegas Airport，由于航班略微延误加上租车等车延误，真正开始Utah Road trip之旅已是上午十二点，比预计的时间晚了整整两个小时。当然，计划赶不上变化，我们能做的也就是马不停蹄地直奔Zion National Park。</p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image@master/2023/202303240119004.png" alt="这是我第一次开大型七座车，刚上车的时候还有些胆怯，直到上高速一脚油门便快速适应了起来"></p><p>路上罕见地遇到了堵车，为了打发时间，我摇下窗户，像一个老司机一样手耷拉在窗户上，尽情感受内华达还算温情的阳光沐浴。我把音乐声音调到最大，Take Me Home, Country Roads响彻整个车里，伴随着的还有卫龙Chinese Snacks独一无二的辛辣气味。一个没开过几次车的老司机，吃着中国的辣条，在内华达和犹他州的交界处肆意歌唱歌词里的west Virgina，别是一般荒唐的尽兴。一路上我们看到了非常多奇特的地质景观，每每经过都叹为观止，殊不知这可能是未来一周旅行中最平淡的景观了。</p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image@master/2023/202303240126364.png" alt="5 Idiots"></p><h2 id="Trails"><a href="#Trails" class="headerlink" title="Trails"></a>Trails</h2><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image@master/2023/202303240128669.png" alt="快到达Zion之前"></p><p>到了Zion NP之后，天气非常不明朗，厚厚的乌云挡住了一切阳光，却裹挟着冰雹和雨水降临。当我们刚把车在Visitor Center停好，便遭遇了一股强烈但是短暂的冰雹。之后是连绵不断的中雨，而我们决定做shuttle bus逛几个trails，哪怕天公不作美，我们毕竟已经到了这里。</p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image@master/2023/202303240131297.png" alt="园区里非常著名而且短小的一个trail，景色确实无敌美。数个瀑布在大雨天交相辉映，尤为壮观。那种视觉带来的纵深感和听觉带来的叠加感是永远无法用镜头捕捉到的"></p><p>接着我们走到了Par‘us Trail，也算是非常popular的一个trail，在峡谷地势较缓的地方穿行。两岸的景观非常奇特，尤其是云非常地低，而且有些云转瞬既逝，于是就有了我“吹”云的照片。</p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image@master/2023/202303240135424.png"></p><h2 id="Angels-Landing"><a href="#Angels-Landing" class="headerlink" title="Angels Landing"></a>Angels Landing</h2><p>这个trail被誉为全北美最危险的trail之一，因为相当于是在悬崖之间行走，去往只有天使才能够到达的顶峰。我们第二天一大早便启程前往，由于温度较低而且前几天有降雨降雪，我们提前租好了要用的spikes套在鞋上来增强抓地力。最后事实证明，没有这些增强摩擦力的铰链，根本无法完成这个trail。</p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image@master/2023/202303240138854.png" alt="这几座山峰给了我一种流浪地球里行星发动机的即视感，一座接着一座，蔚为壮观"></p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image@master/2023/202303240139363.png"></p><p>主观感觉上不到一个半小时我们就达到了overlook，算是angels landing最危险部分的出口处。整个路上充满了之字形山路，当站在山顶向下望来来回回的山路，也是别为壮观。</p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image@master/2023/202303240142685.png" alt="这只是wiggles的十分之一，充满了积雪和冰"></p><p>紧接着便开始了真正的攀登，甚至还没有熟悉绳索的冰凉程度，绳索就不见了。取而代之的是在一个斜面倾斜着身体缓慢前进到大约15m开外的有绳索地带。最开始这一部分，是我认为整个trail最危险的地方了。一是刚刚开始便失去了绳索的帮助，而是坡度确实不容小觑。之后，便是抓着绳索，在极窄的栈道上攀爬行走。由于栈道上布满了冰雪，每次我都尽可能确保鞋底的钉子彻底扎入冰中之后再借力进行下一步。</p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image@master/2023/202303240146313.png"></p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image@master/2023/202303240147297.png" alt="一步之遥便是悬崖"></p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image@master/2023/202303240148825.png" alt="云中行走"></p><p>并没有想象中的吃力，我们便抵达了顶峰。真的是会当凌绝顶，一览众山小。同样的，这种山峰群立带来的纵深感和大自然的磅礴之气只有切身实地才能够感受到。</p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image@master/2023/202303240150990.png"></p><p>我在顶峰找了一个没有那么陡峭的岩石块坐下，静静享受眼前这幅一生难遇的美景在眼前无限展开。大自然的鬼斧神工愈加让我认识到我的渺小，每每想到这里，一切烦恼与压力便释怀了。</p><p>下山的路比上山要难多了，尤其是面对冰雪堆积。尤记得在一段小下坡，全部充满了积雪，根本没有可以落脚的地方。前方的朋友让我滑下来，我便一股脑坐在雪上像滑雪橇一样滑了下去，结果才意识到无法控制自己的速度。幸好前方的朋友在距离悬崖不到一米的地方把我拦了下来，否则后果不堪设想。当然，当我站起来的时候，已经完全感觉不到自己的屁股了。</p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image@master/2023/202303240156192.png"></p><h2 id="总结"><a href="#总结" class="headerlink" title="总结"></a>总结</h2><p>从去年12月份我了解到angels landing，便心心念念想着一定要征服这个trail。到今天终于完成了目标甚是开心，尤其是在冰雪情况下我们依旧登顶成功，这可能是我这辈子距离攀登珠峰最近的体验了。当然，这个trail并没有我想象中的长和难，相比在Shenandoah的old rag，这个对于体力和胆量上的要求都不算高。当然Zion NP整体来看非常值得探索，必定要在夏天再来一次完成涉水步道和更多更多的探险！</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This semester has been surprisingly long, in a positive sense.</p><span id="more"></span><p>This might be the first time I could sit down and begin typing my blog post during a Monday night. I just finished running 10km on a treadmill and am feeling really good right now to write something down.</p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image@master/2023/202302210058617.png" alt="Volunteering with Duke Forest!"></p><p>The semester has been quite long for me. Last semester passed in a blink of the eye while this semester I have experienced so much. By experiencing, I mean mostly emotionally and things happened in my head. For example, I have more responsibilities. Every week I am thinking about how to make sure APO brothers show up to the weekly service events I coordinated. It has proven that my bugging all the time works very well and a decent number of people showed up every time. The moment where more-than-expected people showed up to my events, I felt a strong sense of achievement and mostly happiness. This has been my source of motivations to fulfil my Service VP responsibilities. Apart from that, I was trying to date a girl which didn’t end up very well but costs tremendous mental energy. However, I finally have been through the experience once. It was great to get to partially to know a girl and get a better understanding of love. The ordeal has provided clarity to me, and even the most unremarkable and implausible romance plots in movies now appear plausible and sensible.</p><h2 id="Classes"><a href="#Classes" class="headerlink" title="Classes"></a>Classes</h2><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image@master/2023/202302210101257.png" alt="A diagram to explain concepts in Capital: Critique of Political Economy"></p><p>I very much enjoyed all the classes I am taking, of course except the discrete math class. My favorable class would definitely be Marxism and Society, which I decided to take out of purely curiosity. The professor was extremely good at explaining Marx’s pieces and all the esoteric concepts. To be honest, I didn’t really do the readings but every time he breaks down everything in such an organic and logical way. Mostly importantly, I got a full score on the first midterm! I know it was not a hard core midterm but I at least prove to myself that I am capable of learning something not cs. Reflecting upon the class, I realize I enjoy absorbing all the unique views and ideology proposed by Marx. Whether feasible or not, it is intriguing to get to know his theories. Admittedly, my classmates are way more smarter and insightful than me. Sometimes I could not even understand their speaking in the class. But overall it’s great to simply be with them and be exposed to a distinctive academic environment.</p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image@master/2023/202302210059911.png" alt="Playing Exploding Kittens"></p><p>Similarly, my Intro to Political Philosophy class provides another whole different perspective which ironically Marx refutes about. Reading pieces from Plato, Socrates, Hobbes, Machiavelli was such a fun journey, even though it was painful when composing an academically sound paper to submit. I particularly like Machiavelli’s views and his book The Prince. Most things he stated is so true given the current political dynamics of the world.</p><p>Earth and Ocean Science is not bad at all. The professor is really passionate about his teaching and makes the lecture very engaging. I guess my satisfaction of this class definitely partially comes from my obsession with hiking.</p><h2 id="Summer-plan"><a href="#Summer-plan" class="headerlink" title="Summer plan"></a>Summer plan</h2><p>Initially, it was challenging for me to come to terms with the possibility of not securing a genuine internship for the summer. However, after speaking with several friends, including those who have landed fantastic internships and those who have not, I began to feel a sense of relief about the situation. For now, I am planning to go to Berlin for a study abroad program and then come back to campus for a full-time software engineer job in a lab. However, I am still not sure if I could do both because of the time constraints. If this works out, I might even be able to go to an F1 race in Austria after my Berlin program!</p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image@master/2023/202302210104996.png" alt="I love Durian"></p><h2 id="Updates-on-my-website"><a href="#Updates-on-my-website" class="headerlink" title="Updates on my website"></a>Updates on my website</h2><p>In addition to creating a night-mode option for my blog website and adding more content to haojin.li, I have achieved a long-standing goal by finally purchasing the domain lihaojin.com after waiting for three years. Plus, I have configured the GitHub actions to automatically build and deploy both my blog and haojin.li to my servers located in both China and the United States. Despite how it may sound, I am genuinely thrilled to have made these improvements.</p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image@master/2023/202302210103709.png" alt="Pilot Mountain State Park"></p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>新学期开始了。</p><span id="more"></span><p>很久没有尝试用中文再去记录一些东西，明显得感觉到自己的写作功底下降了不止一些。有时候甚至会忘记一些中文字的写法，想起来着实惭愧。</p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image@master/2023/202301280043831.png" alt="很久没有如此惬意地躺在Duke Gardens了"></p><p>不同于高中，我反而很期待大学的每次开学，无论假期有多么的无忧无虑，开学总是我向往的。一是因为能够再见到朋友们，叙叙旧。开学几天和朋友们寒暄总是最有趣的，因为每个人的假期都十分不同，有去旅游的，回家的，甚至还有待在学校做实验的，无论如何我都能感慨万千。二是可以在全新的课程里认识一群新的朋友，新的教授。尤其是这学期的选课，作为计算机专业，我选了两门政治科学，一门计算机和一门用来满足毕业需要的地质学课。我最期待的就是两门政治科学：马克思主义和社会还有政治哲学入门。上学期中国包括世界范围发生的运动彻底改变了我对世界，对政治，对自己的理解，我认为这两门课能够让我更加保持清醒，保持“痛苦”。如果能够坚持得下来，甚至可以兼修政治科学。</p><p>自己身边的朋友，大多数都是计算机或者理科专业，和他们聊天和交流是一种感觉。走进政治课堂，认识新的朋友，和他们沟通交流又是截然不同的一种氛围。并不是说孰好孰坏，但明显两类人是以不同的视角了解这个世界，而我很珍惜这样的机会，让自己能够多方面地汲取知识，了解这个世界。</p><p>开学三周了，至少到现在，比上学期自律了很多。很少出现一个午觉睡过了整个下午的情况，反而因为恰当的课程时间安排，我最懒惰的时间总是正好是上课时间，正好抵消了我自己的惰性。同时，这学期的课程基本都需要签到，对我而言起到了非常积极的作用。同时，我才发现每门课凑巧都有自己认识的朋友，互相促进总是好的。</p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image@master/2023/202301280045121.png" alt="在湖边点篝火，看星星在湖中的倒影"></p><p>除了课业之外，我还在想办法找夏天的实习机会。说实话，处在放弃的边缘。或许是因为经济大环境不好，抑或是自己还不够努力，到现在为止的结果却是无法令人满意。我在考虑学校的柏林留学项目，或者待在学校再实习一年，总之不会回国。我觉得父母说的有道理，趁着年轻有机会，多出去走走看看，哪怕旅游也比呆在家里有意义得多。</p><p>当然，这学期成为了fraternity的service vp，自己也很开心能够成为exec的一员。协调沟通所有的volunteer活动却是很繁琐，但当我看到很多成员都来参加活动的时候，那种成就感是难以言喻的。帮助别人确实能够给自己带来极大的快乐和幸福感。</p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image@master/2023/202301280046754.png" alt="和朋友们包了400多个饺子，喂饱了我们所有人还有冰箱"></p><p>最近还有些为情所困，但也正因这个契机，让我更看清楚了自己在一段亲密关系里是一个什么样的角色，我想成为什么样的角色，我期望对方是什么样的角色。同时，自己也确实意识到寻求帮助的重要性，当局者迷，旁观者清让我深有体会。很多朋友对于此事给予了我很多帮助，也让我意识到自己在这个方面还是一个连蹒跚学步都算不上的婴儿，需要多经历，不怕失败。无论结果如何，对我而言都学到了很多，我也相信这是一种启示，让我至少尝试去和别人建立更深的关系。</p><p>对于这个学期，没有过多的展望，只想活好每一天，就像之前的每一天一样，不虚度光阴，即为幸福。</p><p>祝好。</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Well yes I flew all the way from the far north to the far south…</p><span id="more"></span><h2 id="Toronto-to-be-continued"><a href="#Toronto-to-be-continued" class="headerlink" title="Toronto to be continued"></a>Toronto to be continued</h2><p>Toronto is my friend’s base and we started our road trip from here while I didn’t have enough time to fully explore the city before the road trip. Therefore, after coming back from Montreal and Ottawa, I spent almost a week wandering in the city. I basically visited all the must-go places here in Toronto.</p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image@master/2023/202301110025594.png" alt="Absolutely the city skyline"></p><p>We bought a ferry ticket to one of the island in the Lake Ontario to get the best view of the city skyline. It was freezing cold as expected but the view was amazing. We even stayed for more than two hours waiting for the night view of this charming city.</p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image@master/2023/202301110030030.png" alt="Cold but beautiful night views"></p><p>After that, of course I need to go up to the CN tower to see the night view from another perspective. I’ve been once here when I was a elementary school kid coming here for a math competition during Summer 2015. That time was daytime while this time I am able to do it at night. As the highest observatory in North America, it is simply stunning. However, it’s definitely not worth it to purchase the extra pricy ticket to the Skypod which is 100m higher than the main observatory because you pretty much see the exact same view even given a huge elevation gain.</p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image@master/2023/202301110035303.png" alt="Me at the top"></p><h2 id="Niagara-Falls"><a href="#Niagara-Falls" class="headerlink" title="Niagara Falls"></a>Niagara Falls</h2><p>We also drove to Niagara Falls and stayed there for a night. I’ve also been here the last time during the summer and the same got the chance to appreciate the mighty nature once more from a whole new perspective of winter.</p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image@master/2023/202301110042387.png" alt="Wonderland"></p><p>During the night, there were spotlight for the falls and it was astonishing. Even though we were expecting the entire falls to be frozen, it wasn’t due to a unexpectedly above freezing point temperature. That being said, it was still amazing to see the spotlight combined with the living falls. It was also great as the spotlight changed its color in a dynamic way.</p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image@master/2023/202301110038679.png" alt="What&#39;s more, there was also fireworks!"></p><p>The daytime Niagara Falls is not as pretty as night’s but still worth visiting. I even found the position to make a time travel photos.</p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image@master/2023/202301110044272.png" alt="19-year-old me in Winter 2022 and 12-year-old in Summer 2015"></p><h2 id="Why-did-I-decide-also-to-go-to-Mexico"><a href="#Why-did-I-decide-also-to-go-to-Mexico" class="headerlink" title="Why did I decide also to go to Mexico?"></a>Why did I decide also to go to Mexico?</h2><p>It was not on my radar in the very beginning. However, the friend I planed to visit in Toronto proposed the idea and magically he sorted everything out back in early October. Why not then? I thought it would be really cool to experience both the far north and south, the hottest and the coldest within one winter break so I just did it.</p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image@master/2023/202301110048998.png" alt="I just wanted to show the custom at Cancun airport..."></p><h2 id="XCARET"><a href="#XCARET" class="headerlink" title="XCARET"></a>XCARET</h2><p>The Cancun trip was simple to tell as it was simply amazing and I had my best hotel and park experience at XCARET. I would’ve bought the autobiography book XUEÑOS by XCARET founder Miguel Quintana Pali if I knew how to read Spanish. I was shocked by how beautiful, naturally preserved, friendly all the parks are.</p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image@master/2023/202301110057552.png" alt="We lived in one of those suites with two amazing sea view balcony"></p><p>That being said, I felt really guilty enjoying all these overly luxury experience. I felt thankful to the friend who made all these happen and brought this wonderful experience but in the meantime myself would definitely choose more economical way to enjoy the vacation here as I do not believe myself deserve this kind of services and material comforts. I would definitely come back with the family or friends I love but with a more reasonable lodging environment. The Luxury is once-in-a-lifetime and is already enough for me.</p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image@master/2023/202301110058533.png" alt="This show made me a huge fan of Mexican well-preserved culture and talented people"></p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image@master/2023/202301110059431.png" alt="Panoramic through a scenery tower in one of the most popular parks"></p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image@master/2023/202301110102702.png" alt="Enjoy the Michelin level taco"></p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image@master/2023/202301110102027.png" alt="The hotel outdoors without filter or any editing"></p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image@master/2023/202301110103049.png" alt="Driving the jeep topless in the forest!"></p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image@master/2023/202301110104464.png" alt="Swim in the Natural Caverns"></p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image@master/2023/202301110105770.png" alt="Yes, driving the jeep again at night"></p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image@master/2023/202301110107430.png" alt="Drank too much free cocktails and then rolled on the beach:("></p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image@master/2023/202301110108115.png" alt="Last free dinner with Chef Teppanyaki"></p><p>And that’s my winter break.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So here I am in Canada.</p><span id="more"></span><p>I always wanted to come back to Canada again after my miserable last visit that I lost all my checked-in luggage due to a mistake at the layover. However, it didn’t stop me from experiencing and appreciating this beautiful country.</p><p>I decided to go there during the winter break mainly because one of my old friend who is in University of Toronto now invited me during the summer. It took a bit efforts for me to get the visa but everything sorted out quickly after that thanks to the help of my friend.</p><p>I know it is not the best time to visit this country as it is freezing cold but I still wanted to go simply for curiosity. At least, there will be much fewer visitors everywhere I go.</p><h2 id="Toronto"><a href="#Toronto" class="headerlink" title="Toronto"></a>Toronto</h2><p>I only spent a day in Toronto, catching up with high school friends mainly. I was really excited to see how they have changed since the last time I saw them was almost 2 years ago. It turned out we never changed. The moment I met them, I felt like going back time to high school, when we dedicated hundreds of hours in VEX robotics together, complaining, debating, practicing, team-working. I would say that is certainly the highlight of my high school life, even plus my middle school time.</p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image@master/2023/202212270142761.png" alt="My friend and I"></p><p>One of the friend, who I never thought we could be friend, became really close friend with me, at least by my definition. We are just like the people in completely two different world, yet we get along really well. With this reunion, I enjoyed talking to him very much with nonsense jokes and gossips about our high school.</p><p>It was a bit sad when I realized there is not a certain next time about when we will meet again. However I do know we care about each other and wish each other the best of the best. 君子之交淡如水。</p><p>The only agenda for the visitor part is the Royal Ontario Museum, which I personally don’t really like. There is definitely historical significant exhibits inside but they were really fragmented and scattered in my opinion. Therefore for museum rookie like me, I cannot grasp the full beauty and significance of the museum. After all, it is a decent visit while hanging out with friends a bit.</p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image@master/2023/202212270149066.png" alt="Royal Ontario Museum looks pretty cool for sure"></p><h2 id="Montreal"><a href="#Montreal" class="headerlink" title="Montreal"></a>Montreal</h2><p>I knew nothing about Montreal. I learned from my friend that the entire province of Quebec is speaking French and all the road signs are only in French. I literally became illiteracy over there but didn’t prevent me from experiencing the culture and the city.</p><p>It is one of the best cities I’ve ever visited. The downtown area is full of the vibe of arts and the french romantics. It was having snowstorm when we arrived which I never saw before. A terrible weather for others surprisingly became a first-time experience for me. I very much enjoyed the snow during the first day. Sliding and playing snow on the street was so much fun for me just like a kid.</p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image@master/2023/202212270148770.png" alt="Sliding on the street"></p><h3 id="Food"><a href="#Food" class="headerlink" title="Food"></a>Food</h3><p>The food is amazing here. We had some great Spanish, French and Chinese food here. Besides Chinese food, the other two exotic cuisine were far better than my expectations. Indeed they look really fancy, but they tasted really well and you can actually get enough to eat at a reasonable price.</p><p>Some of the restaurants also have great vibes with dimmed light and special seat layouts. Frankly, I am never a foodie especially during the trip as I care more about the cultures and the places we go. However, I do have a great impression on the food culture here.</p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image@master/2023/202212270153215.png" alt="A French Brunch"></p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image@master/2023/202212270154788.png" alt="And a French Supper"></p><h3 id="F1-Circuit-Gilles-Villeneuve"><a href="#F1-Circuit-Gilles-Villeneuve" class="headerlink" title="F1 Circuit Gilles Villeneuve!"></a>F1 Circuit Gilles Villeneuve!</h3><p>I’ve always been a huge fan of Formula One and here we go! This is the first circuit I’ve been to and it was amazing even at a temperature of -16 degree. I felt extremely excited when walking through the starting grids and the pit lane where I saw on the TV every time with awesome formula one cars passing by.</p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image@master/2023/202212270156396.png" alt="It looks like a normal street but made me so excited"></p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image@master/2023/202212270159104.png" alt="The 3rd starting grid"></p><h3 id="Biodome"><a href="#Biodome" class="headerlink" title="Biodôme"></a>Biodôme</h3><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image@master/2023/202212270201174.png" alt="Yes this is in Montreal.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It has been a bittersweet semester with so many things happening out of control in an unexpected way.</p><span id="more"></span><p>Always, the frequency that I update my blog to some extent could represent my mood during a specific period of time. For example, during last year at this time, I was stressed out with tons of college applications happening on. Apparently, I got into the same situation again with hundreds of internship applications to send out, wait, and be rejected. Apart from that, the classes I took this semester has played a huge role in a huge shift of my value, political understandings and my world view, which might have already changed my life entirely.</p><p>I wouldn’t say it was a better nor worse semester compared to my freshman year. Objectively, I participated in fewer events, clubs and socials while subjectively speaking I learned and grew more internally.</p><p>I could not really have a comprehensive rewind of my entire semester yet there are always something I would never forget and pop up instantly while I am writing this.</p><h1 id="APO"><a href="#APO" class="headerlink" title="APO"></a>APO</h1><p>Since I pledged last Spring at APO with a super random motivation that a Duke alum recommended me to try it out, I have been much more involved and interested in the organization as I thought I would be. I wouldn’t say it is the most important or valuable experience I have, but somehow it leaves to the end after I quitted so many clubs. I simply enjoy being here and doing volunteering works with other Duke students. It might because partially I would like to repay my “guilt” that I had not participated enough services back in high school.</p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20221225001953.png" alt="Catan during Pledge Retreat"></p><p>The most unforgettable service event I had this semester was a baseball game for children with special needs. As the Service Chair, it was the first event that I coordinated individually without the help from the Service VP. I was worried about nobody would show up to the event while it turned out to be around 10 people with me bugging everyone within the organization. I was really excited to see so many people coming to the event I coordinated, and most importantly brought happiness to those lovely children.</p><p>In the end of the semester, I was elected to be the Service VP, which means it is time for me to take all the responsibilities of coordinating all kinds of service events. It is a time-consuming works but at the same time it is a well-rewarding job. One of the main side work I have for this winter break is to sort out everything for next semester before it begins. And frankly, I am ready and take it seriously to make sure everything is going to work smoothly in the next semester.</p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20221220162753.png" alt="Book Harvest - One of the many service events I attended this semester"></p><h1 id="Recruitment"><a href="#Recruitment" class="headerlink" title="Recruitment"></a>Recruitment</h1><p>Well, it is tough. I have nothing to say but frustrations. I considered myself well-prepared in the very beginning of the semester and applied countless jobs with such confidence that I would stand out from other candidates. However, things always happen differently. I began to be stressed out, seeing people around me getting so many awesome job opportunities. It reminds me of the last year when I applied for colleges. They gave me the same level of mental burdens and physical fatigues.</p><p>Anyway, my expectation began to shift. Still, I have the backup plan to work for the OIT office on FixIt for the next summer or to go to the bootcamp and study abroad opportunity in Cape Town which many people consider as a scam while I believe it is the best fit for me as I love traveling and see different things all across the world.</p><p>Another main task for the winter is be more prepared and apply more companies, which I will try my best and hope for the best for.</p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20221224235701.png" alt="The only good thing is that I had my 6th visit to Microsoft offices. This time is in RTP"></p><h1 id="My-world-view-shifted"><a href="#My-world-view-shifted" class="headerlink" title="My world view shifted"></a>My world view shifted</h1><p>I have so much to say regarding this. In the classic sci-fi movie The Matrix, the protagonist was asked to choose between the blue pill (Reality) and the red one (Conceived world). I was facing the same choice this semester and I chose the blue pill by accident which was extremely painful and disturbing for me to confront with all the cruel truth.</p><p>It all starts with the trip to Ashvile. I was debating with my friends about the party. I believed in my country and the party to bring the best for the people even given so many disrupted misinformation from the western media. However, I could not rebuttal almost every of his arguments.</p><p>Then, in two humanity classes that I took: Migrant China and Comparative Approach to Global Issues, I learned about the concept of “imagined community” and directly see the life of Chinese migrant workers from the bottom working class through the lens of documentary and so many academic literatures. I was more and more astonished and shocked with more lectures going on. Moreover, as the social movement happening in China, everything add together significantly complicated my views on myself, my country and the world.</p><p>I couldn’t say much or do much about this for now but I do understand one lesson: China is not a superior country compared to US or any countries in the world. Rather, they are inheritly equally problematic.</p><p>A more tangible change for myself is I suddenly realized the significance of liberal arts education and decided to pursue a BA (currently considering political science) besides BS in computer science. Since I do believe science teaches me modern techniques and equips me with powerful knowledge that gives me more and more confidence while learning deeper. On the other hand, social sciences and humanities teaches me all the hard truth and evil appearance. It forces me to take the blue pill and let me confront with everything. I could not escape. I became destablized but a much broader understanding of the world, the real world. This is something I really want to do in my college years even it is hard, and might be useless since it wouldn’t help me in any utilitarian point of view. In a nutshell, I want to be knowledgeable rather than ignorant although ignorance is such a great blessing which rules my life for 19 years.</p><h1 id="MakeNew"><a href="#MakeNew" class="headerlink" title="MakeNew"></a>MakeNew</h1><p>This is my first semester after becoming a Christian. To many extents, I feel more connected with God and my sins. God is showing everything to me at the right moment while letting me to digest and reflect on. I feel extremely grateful and warm with makenew friends all around me. I started to understand the meaning of the church and how kind, selfless, powerful, loving, holy Jesus is. I know God is going to give me more and I will take all to repent. Life is not simply about being a good man. Rather, it is about acknowledging my earthly limitations and striving for the heavenly fruits.</p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20221220163300.png" alt="I LOVE bonfire"></p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20221220163419.png" alt="I don&#39;t why but it looks like cyberpunk vibe"></p><h1 id="Hiking"><a href="#Hiking" class="headerlink" title="Hiking"></a>Hiking</h1><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20221225000056.png" alt="Kayaking!"></p><p>I just realized how much I love hiking. I planned out my first ever entire hiking trip to Shenandoah National Park and drove 700 miles within 3 days. Nature empowers me so much that I can’t help exploring it as much as I can.</p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20221220161624.png" alt="Blue Ridge Mountains~"></p><p>For the spring semester, I am going to the Mighty 5 National Parks in Utah plus Great Canyon NP with so much excitement in my heart. Also, I found one of my goal of life: finishing the 2k miles Appalachian Trails.</p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20221225000421.png" alt="Jump into the Fall!"></p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It was my first ever self-planed hiking roadtrip which turned out to be amazing ever since the very beginning.</p><span id="more"></span><p>I’ve always been a huge fan of the song <em>Take me home, country road</em> by John Denver. Every friend of mine knows how much I’d love to sing this song for no reason randomly. And it would be great to discover all the places mentioned in the lyrics, which is the one and only reason I planned out this Shenandoah trip. “Blue Ridge Mountains, Shenandoah River~”</p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20221225004933.png" alt="My crew"></p><p>I started planning a month ahead in order to book the best hotel and I was simply excited about it since a long time ago. And it turned out all my plannings were necessary and actually helped us a lot on the way because of my familiarity of the park.</p><h1 id="Day-1-Hikes-amp-Sunset-amp-Stargazing"><a href="#Day-1-Hikes-amp-Sunset-amp-Stargazing" class="headerlink" title="Day 1 Hikes &amp; Sunset &amp; Stargazing"></a>Day 1 Hikes &amp; Sunset &amp; Stargazing</h1><p>We set off from Duke at around 7 and wasted 2 hours on breakfast that we hadn’t left Durham by 8:30am. I was a bit reckless during the frist few hours driving since I never drove in North Carolina but I got used to it very quick. Since we were going to the South entrance of the Park which is along the Blue Ridge Parkway, mainly all the road we drove were state roads instead of faster interstates. Nevertheless, it was another kind of enjoyment while you could see the vast ranches with cows, horses and sheep on the way. What’s more, I got a legitimate reason to loop <em>Take me home, country road</em> !</p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20221225005436.png" alt="Three idiots haha"></p><p>We arrived around noon and started our first hike which is called Black Rock. It was a short warm-up trail but with unique piles of piles of rocks in the end of the trail. We climbed to the top of the rock overlooking the mountains.</p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20221225004644.png" alt="Black Rock"><br><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20221225005100.png" alt="Overlook"></p><p>Our second trail is Doyles River Falls which is a bit strenuous with great elevations ups and downs. There are upper and lower two falls and are definitely worth visiting.</p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20221225005654.png" alt="Upper fall"></p><p>The sunset was much earlier than we thought. After the second hike, we had half an hour to find a overlook for sunset. Indeed, it took us exactly half an hour to find a perfect outlook. This was the best sunset I had ever seen before. Because of the elevation, we were able to see the entire skyline without any obstructions. The wideness and the richness of the color layers of the sunset was beyond amazing.</p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20221225010104.png" alt="Amazing amazing"></p><p>The stargazing was also amazing as we also saw a lot of deers at night in the park. It was freezing cold but I was able to see three fleeting but shining shooting starts which is all I wanted.</p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20221225010702.png" alt="A sky full of stars~"></p><h1 id="Day-2-6-hour-trail-amp-Bonfire"><a href="#Day-2-6-hour-trail-amp-Bonfire" class="headerlink" title="Day 2 6-hour trail &amp; Bonfire"></a>Day 2 6-hour trail &amp; Bonfire</h1><p>This day we mainly got one event: climb a mountain along a 6-hour strenuous trail. I never did such a long trail before and I was excited to see how it began. The trail is called Old Rag and is the highest rating trail within the park. The first part of the trail is classic winding some trails which was ok but still takes us at least two hours. We were able to reach a high overlook to see the ranch and mountains in the same frame which was simply marvellous.</p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20221225010945.png" alt="The le epic overlook"></p><p>The second part was quite challenging but interesting. It was all about rock scrambles. We were literally rock climbing but in a different way.</p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20221225011113.png" alt="The path was even covered by ice"></p><p>Then we arrived at the top of the mountain. IT WAS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL MOUNTAIN TOP. I was able to approach a cliff which really scared me but gave me a once in a life time view of the nature.</p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20221225011324.png" alt="Pondering while sitting at the edge of the cliff"></p><p>The last part of the trail was actually the hardest part. After reaching the top, going back to the beginning is hard since the goal was already accomplished. It took us longer for the come-back trail compared with climbing up. However, it was a great experience that we all managed to push ourselves to the limit.</p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20221225011714.png" alt="远方"></p><p>This trail inspired me to take on more difficult trails in the future which I am going to do during the Spring Break and my life.</p><p>The last thing we did was bonfire at night. It was miraculously better than I thought with no one having prior knowledge of lighting a fire with woods. We ended up cheating using some chemical liquids but the fire was amazing. With my favorite songs from the speaker, I enjoyed the moment so much.</p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20221225012043.png" alt="Cold air with hot fire and shining stars"></p><h1 id="Day-3-Luray-Caverns-amp-Skyline-Drive"><a href="#Day-3-Luray-Caverns-amp-Skyline-Drive" class="headerlink" title="Day 3 Luray Caverns &amp; Skyline Drive"></a>Day 3 Luray Caverns &amp; Skyline Drive</h1><p>We went to a world-famous Caverns in the town of Luray that we lived in. The caverns was much larger than I thought and was definitely worth visiting even you are not interested in caverns in the first place. The most astonishing view for me is the reflection of reef in the water. It looks exactly like two real reefs at the top and the bottom respectively.</p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20221225012418.png" alt="Only the upper side is real"></p><p>In the afternoon, we continued to drive on the rest of the Skyline Drive and stopped by a few overlooks to appreciate this great landscape gifted by the nature.</p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20221225012615.png" alt="from cloudy to sunny"></p><p>All in all this is one of the best roadtrip I have ever had and I do find I have a great passion in hiking. I always put all my enthusiasm into planning which I believe I am a good planner. I would love these kind of trips happening more and more. If you do read until here, please let me know if you are interested in any roadtrip with me if you are also a fan of either hiking or just simply nature. I promise I will be the best guide you find (exempted from legal liability though haha).</p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20221225013430.png" alt="Will see you next time, Shenandoah NP!"></p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Wooooo summer can’t be better.</p><span id="more"></span><p>Since last post, I set off to California for a 23 days vacation. I was beyond thrilled to start the journey and also beyond excited to move forward for the new semester as a sophomore.</p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20220828233731.png" alt="Big Sur"></p><p>I remembered it was such a long flight flying over there with one layover. I could not wait to see all my friends who I haven’t seen for an entire year. Shortly after my arrival, I drove the car we just rented to pick up the last friend who were coming by train. That was my first time officially driving in US and I didn’t even realize how to use the foot brake. It took me a while to figure out stopping the alarm from beeping. The night was quite creepy that most roads were closed which were supposed to lead to the train station. Three of us just on the car, happily joking about each other. The moment we successfully found the spot and greet our last friend, it was such a defining moment for our trip. No tears, no dramas but purely happiness of each and every one of us.</p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20220828234212.png" alt="Apple Park haha!"></p><p>We started to explore the city of Irvine, which is indeed very nice. I had countless great Chinese food that I believe are even better than actually China’s. Admittedly, they are quite expensive but it was time to spend some money and gain some enjoyment from the delicious food. I never really had any non-Chinese restaurant as I did realize that I have a very typical “Chinese stomachache”. All exotic food are just for fun experience and Chinese food are in effect the food for life.</p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20220828233807.png" alt="Black&#39;s Beach in San Diego"></p><p>What’s more, we went to all-you-can-imagine beaches in California. I wouldn’t say they are better than those of east coasts’ but I did get a chance to watch fabulous sunset along the coast. The light, the dark and the shade during the dusk were amazing in all means. The famous 17 miles drive also amazed me with how azure the ocean is and how plentiful the layers of ocean are. It was such a pleasure to drive along this famous road.</p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20220828234250.png" alt="Yosemite"></p><p>Talking about the most unforgettable memory from the trip, it must be the entire clear Milky Way with numerous stars in the sky above Sequoia National Park &amp; Kings Canyon. I had never seen that many stars and that kind of sky in my entire life. It was mind blowing. I ended up driving back around 10 and it was dark and scary on the winding mountain roads where not even one car passed by for 50 miles.</p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20220828233951.png" alt="Newport Beach"></p><p>Inspired by one of my friend, I became much more adventurous during the trip. I climbed up to the top of the Yosemite Lower Fall, dived into the cold water with normal shirts and shorts. I enjoyed it very much. Also inspired by another friend, the greatness of the nature always reminds me of how great and powerful our God is.</p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20220828234327.png" alt="Kings Canyon"></p><p>There are also Humanistic elements along the coast. Solvang, Hearst Castle, Salinas, San Diego they are all great cities &#x2F; towns that bring joys.</p><p>Apart from what I have seen , I also grew in terms of essential life skills. Driving over 2000 miles, handling all housekeeping stuff myself, plan everything on my own, these are all invaluable experiences that cultivate how I interact with the world and be what kind of person.</p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20220828234053.png" alt="Santa Barbara"></p><p>A strange feeling I have for the trip is that I not really miss it or wish it could be longer since I do have had everything that can have. I am fulfilled in terms of this matter and won’t regret on anything.</p><p>Also I realize I do love the suburb living styles just as Durham area. I hate SF, LA very much and won’t even consider living near those mega cities if given a choice.</p><p>Alright, it’s time to kick off a new semester and embrace new challenges in academia, life, work and faith.</p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20220828233701.png" alt="Moro Rock"></p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The flight to California is just to long to do anything. So why not wrapping up my summer so far.</p><span id="more"></span><p>Less than a month until the next school year. Looking back at the past three months, I have accimplished and grown so much that I would never imagine before everything started.</p><p>The main part of this summer is definitely code plus. I learned so much over the course of 10 weeks. I never built any app or any comprehensive project that could be used for actual users and most of them were just a single program that takes certain inputs and calculates outputs as demanded. FixIt is an actual web application that Duke people could use in the future. I am also very grateful for all the people I met through Code+, who I hanged out with every weekend and karoake all day long. That was such a great experience for me. More than that, Code+ is an actual full-time job that provides me an invaluable opportunity to take a glimpse of what does it look like to work in tech field. I would say it could not be better. I am very determined that software engineer is what I want to be in the future and I dreadfully enjoyed the entire coding and developing process. One core thing I learned from this work is definitely communications and collaborations with teammates, sponsors and stakeholders. To be honest, it was not a very pleasant experience working with some of my collegues but because of their unwillingness to get things done, I got a lot of things done and learned frontend, backend, devops and product design&#x2F;management which are a lot of stuff to learn in 10 weeks. Thus, in the future, I plan to keep working on the project to put it into production to make impacts on the Duke community.</p><p>This summer, I genuinely feel fruitful in terms of what I have gained. Besides technical skills and career goals, I have grown spiritually. I believe it’s God’s will to let me spend the summer with Makenew and let them guide me on my path to faith. I am still confused, scared and self-centered, but I know what is the truth and I have the willingness to move forward to be closer to God and confront my sins.</p><p>Also leetcoding is becoming a habit for me now. I am very looking forward to the recruitment season and hope I could have the offer I want. Especially when one of the DevOps folks in Duke OIT office asked me: “where are you going for internship next year? Google or Facebook?” I was flattered and was really delighted that people see and acknowledge my skills and passion in terms of software engineering. I am confident. Also I am really grateful for one of my friend who are doing mock interview with me every week to help me in every means. I could not be more appreciate his help and guidence.</p><p>In summary, it is the only ever summer I feel like that I actually made some positive learning and progress rather than having pure fun every day and feeling guilty after summer ended. I LOVE this summer and better things will come!</p><p>Looking forwad to what’s going to happen in California.</p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20220731013433.png"></p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today I become a Christian.</p><span id="more"></span><p>I always imagine this day would come in a natural way that by that time, I have already fully known God and fully admitted  my own sin and how Jesus died on the cross for me. However, this day comes in an unexpected way. I haven’t fully known God nor fully repented my sin but I do have a strong willingness to eager for a meaningful and eternal relationship with God, who I believe is the Creator of the world and us. He sacrifices so much that no human being could bear it. We keep rebelling and disappointing and even killed God. His grace is still there, always there.</p><p>I know every truth that I should know to have a leap of faith. It’s just I haven’t felt it in a strong and powerful way. But I truly believe that day will come. It is frightening, but I would like Jesus to be the center of my life and teaches me how to be a Christian and understand God.</p><p>Promises to keep, miles to go.</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It’s again been a long time since I wrote the last post.</p><span id="more"></span><p>I used to skip blogging because I don’t have a lot things to write during that period of time. However, there are too much these days that I even could not fully experience let alone recording them in written.</p><h2 id="Pre-Code"><a href="#Pre-Code" class="headerlink" title="Pre-Code+"></a>Pre-Code+</h2><p>After coming back from the beach week, I moved to friends’ apartment near west campus. It is the first time ever I lived someplace truly independent. Campus dorm doesn’t count since I could get everything I want within walking distance. Also there are staffs taking care of all housekeeping and tedious logistics things for you.</p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20220619174125.png" alt="View from the floor of the livng room"></p><p>It was nice staying in an independent place, though sleeping on the floor in the living room. I slept unexpectedly really well every night and developed some good habits that I should have had a long time ago. I took a shower every morning to wake myself which I normally did at night since I could not get up in the morning. I continued to cook food for myself but more frequently. I started to practice LeetCode problems every day with friends on Zoom. I kept working in Perkins OIT desk to earn some pocket money.</p><p>In a nutshell, this is the first ever summer I felt like I am being productive instead of doing nothing.</p><h2 id="Code"><a href="#Code" class="headerlink" title="Code+"></a>Code+</h2><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20220619174004.png" alt="Moving back to campus"></p><p>It’s Code+ time. To be honest, I have a lot of expectations toward the program. I got kind of disappointed in the first week of Code+ since we attended quite a few extremely entry-level programming classes and useless lectures. Then I started to learn everything we need for our project by myself. It turned out really well.</p><p>Also supporting staffs of the program are really helpful who I learned a lot from. It feels exciting to build an actual website that could help Duke students. I have to say that I enjoy working every day 9 to 5 and debugging all tricky problems I encountered. That sense of achievement has made me convinced and determined to be a software engineer at least in the near future.</p><p>Some fellow participants said I was really smart and the prototype I built was really awesome. But I do believe there’s nothing difficult of what I achieved. I just put all my efforts and I am genuinely interested in software development. It’s nothing like algorithm design or academic researches that I believe require high understanding of knowledge and IQ. Nevertheless, it is an important work that makes differences to people’s life. It is a miniature of amazing high technologies that human has developed. This is exactly what I would love to do. I am delighted that Code+ not only “forces” me to learn skills myself but also makes me confident and determined in software development.</p><h2 id="Cooking"><a href="#Cooking" class="headerlink" title="Cooking"></a>Cooking</h2><h2 id="Hang-out"><a href="#Hang-out" class="headerlink" title="Hang out"></a>Hang out</h2><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20220619174304.png" alt="Eno River Quarry: jumping into a lake first ever in my life"></p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20220619174417.png" alt="2022 Commencement: It was freezing cold and I was wearing a single shirt"></p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20220630220224.png" alt="Cooking for my friends!!!"></p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20220630220258.png" alt="Beach is my dream"></p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20220630220415.png" alt="Falls Lake (I should have jumped into the lake again)"></p><p><em>There are just too much to share about my life… :)</em></p><p>Best,<br>Haojin</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Standing at the myrtle beach today, I began to reflect on my Freshman journey. </p><span id="more"></span><p>I feel very blessed and fortuated enough to have what I have seen, experienced, and learned from this school year. I never thought my first year in college would be as good as it went through. I was questioning about fate and believed everything is in my control if I worked hard enough. It is just not the truth after experiencing and contemplating on all the things that happened to me. </p><p>I am grateful for my fate. I only had in total a month of online school classes since the covid began. When the virus hitting US, I had come back to normal school mood back in China. As now the virus explodes in China, I have come to US for studying. I still hate Zoom and cannot imagine how my friends went through even all-year-long online courses. I feel like everything in my life is finely presetted so I could have the best outcome as possible. In this sense, I believe myself as a special person as I am certainly being blessed by someone or something that I do not think others have in the same way as I have.</p><p>I am grateful for people around me. I know I have already said this over and over again, but I do genuienly feel this way. Opporuntities, happinesses and thoughts I have, those are all brought by someone else than me. I have met so many talented, passionate, unique and interesting people at Duke that makes me feel previliged to talk to them. I woudld like to list them all but I could not since the list would be super long. It is amazing that how many people have helped me and together shaped me into the person I am today.</p><p>Looking back at the entire school year, there are also countless highlight moments for me. A random dinner with friends, a road-trip, a makenew Friday, whatsoever… But it never is how I grinded out an exam or what is my quiz score on certain tests. I believe, at least for me, grades is the least important thing among all those important things. As long as I have no regrets to myself, I do not think I should put more time on grades. But also, classes are more important than grades as I always tried to do an interesting but harder question rather than easy but boring one. I did that on my phiolosophy final and I felt so good about it that I do not care about the grade anymore as I have spoken what I would like to say and to learn what I want to learn.</p><p>The life is full of adventures ahead waiting for me. Life is fantastic and just best of the best. I kind of understand why 生命 and 生活 are both life in English—因为我像爱生命一样爱我的生活，爱生活一样爱着我的生命。</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Well the true March Madness we lost. But we are the final four!</p><span id="more"></span><p>I never enjoyed watching a basketball game but this time.

I never intend to join a frat but intend to join an organization where I could do good deeds usually. So I guess this is a perfect choice for me. When the first time I participated APO event, people here were chilled and there was a vibe of chilling in general which I enjoyed a lot. </p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20220409233840.png" alt="Help packing food for people in need"></p><p>it turned out not bad.

Although each time it took me 4 hours, 5pm to 9pm, to cook, eat and clean. I never thought I could fall in love with cooking rather than eating since I never cooked before and never wanted to cook back in China.</p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20220409235029.png" alt="I finally took advantage of the Wok"></p><p>But I was right about myself: if I am pushed to do so, I will do so. I love cooking partly because it is a way to resolve my miss to my hometown (mainly food and my car). Also it is also a great way to socialize with friends as we cook and share together.</p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20220409235134.png" alt="Happy Haojin"></p><p>After quite a few times of failures, I finally made the Coca-Cola Chicken Wing successfully. The moment I tasted the wing, I felt an enormous sense of satisfaction and achievement that I never had before. I finally found a true hobby that I am proud of. </p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20220409235212.png" alt="Dennis&#39;s Stirred Vegetable which was also really good"></p><p>Also when I saw the great amount of oil on the vegetable, I knew it is real Chinese food, this is the real family taste. </p><p>I can’t help imagining learning, trying and cooking all kinds of classic Chinese foods in the coming summer to serve my friends.</p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20220409235512.png" alt="BIG Bowl~"></p><h2 id="F1"><a href="#F1" class="headerlink" title="F1"></a>F1</h2><p>This is the sport I feel like March Madness is happening. Now I understand why people are so crazy about Duke basketball since I have the same or even higher level of craziness for F1. Especially this year the game dynamic has completely changed as Mercedes goes down and King’s return of Ferrari. In addition, our proud Chinese driver Zhou Guanyu has grasped the first-ever point in his first-ever F1 Grand Prix. There were so many dramas and will be more in the future. I am even writing my writing101 paper on Formula 1 which is not like other painful writing assignments and I gained a lot of happiness from doing so.</p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20220410000037.png" alt="What a race"></p><p><strong>Life is truly fantastic for me and I enjoy each and every second of it.</strong></p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20220410000328.png" alt="I just love this picture"></p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It’s been a crazy March that has nothing to do with March Madness, but crazier than March Madness.</p><span id="more"></span><p>I know it has been a long time since the last time I blogged. I was telling myself last semester that I could definitely keep blogging at least every week but it turned out not working at all for this semester. It is not because I am having a worse or not-worth-blogging life compared to the last semester. But on the contrary, I am having a great time, great than ever. I would love to blog everything post by post but I failed to do so. Therefore, here is all. </p><h2 id="Spring-Break"><a href="#Spring-Break" class="headerlink" title="Spring Break"></a>Spring Break</h2><h3 id="Washington-DC-Roadtrip"><a href="#Washington-DC-Roadtrip" class="headerlink" title="Washington DC Roadtrip"></a>Washington DC Roadtrip</h3><p>I never thought I could visit DC twice in three months. But here am I, the second time. What different is that I came with makenew folks, which I enjoyed a lot. I had a wried feeling that DC is very familiar to me even more than Beijing. I remember every street I have been to and every artifact in the museum that I have stopped by. Or just because I never visit a place twice within such a short period of time. However, this feeling is amazing partly because you start to appreciate things in the city rather than being surprised by new things. I could tell that I do love the city, the vibe and the history even though it’s short. I have a theory: 500 years is long that 5000 years. Why? Because you share a common perception of things 500 years ago but not for 5000 years’ since they were too old to understand and relate. This is how I feel about my city Xi’an, the most ancient city in China, and DC.</p><p>Two trips together, I have almost visited all the signature museums around National Mall. Frankly, there is no single piece of art or document that is unforgettable to me, but the general feeling is.</p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20220409224215.png" alt="Pretending I am the stone man"></p><p>For this trip, I enjoyed sitting in a micro dining room with friends while having <em>not spicy</em> ramen that kept me having a runny nose. It was super fun while carrying Daniel on my back in front of the monument. And I can’t stop laughing at myself that asking Sid to go American Indian Museum together, which has become a joke being told by friends over and over again. Also, making completely nonsense sentences in Nathan’s car with one word per person made me laugh for literally four hours. Most importantly, now I have the experience of sleeping with 10+ people on the ground of an Airbnb house.</p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20220409232313.png" alt="Also I was on Daniel&#39;s Back"></p><p>Also I mostly appreciate the time and commitment that makenew people devoted to this trip. I cannot even have a safe plan for four people last time here while they are organizing a trip for 30 people. Relate to what Tim said, I think they are great great testimony of Jesus.</p><h3 id="Asheville"><a href="#Asheville" class="headerlink" title="Asheville"></a>Asheville</h3><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20220409232125.png" alt="Chimney Rock"></p><p>The first, in the true sense, road trip I have ever had. American nature views are so different compared to China’s. There is an unspeakable difference between them. American mountains are more lively in my opinion while China’s are more awe-inspiring. </p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20220409230453.png" alt="group photo!"></p><p>The most memorable things: millions of times of <em>Country Road, Take Me Home</em>; Mr. Chou(ugly in Chinese) Diego; 4 hours of walking and almost climbing to see the fantastic overlook of the entire valley since our car couldn’t pass by the annoying bumps; jumping into 50F river and screaming and losing my glasses. I can’t be happier than all the above things brought to me.</p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20220409230537.png" alt="In the highest mist~"></p><p>Also an unremarkable but heartwarming scene: A father and 5-year-old boy sitting next to us while watching a mediocre sunset on a mediocre hill. I saw the father and boy interacting with each other in a so sweet way. I am envious of that and just can’t help thinking about what kind of father would I become and imagining all unrealistic family things. Unrealistic but exceedingly desirable.</p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20220409231936.png" alt="ZzzZZZzzzZZ"></p><p>Alllso, my birthday. I am so happy that I could celebrate all my birthdays during the break for at least the next 3 years of my life. This is the first birthday I had out of home, which is also the most appreciable birthday I had. I appreciate Mattew’s professional birthday songs and Andy and Min and Jordan’s unprofessional birthday songs. I felt far close to home while far away from home.</p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20220409231520.png" alt="Yo!"></p><h3 id="Birthday"><a href="#Birthday" class="headerlink" title="Birthday"></a>Birthday</h3><p>Yes, birthday again. I didn’t expect I would have another birthday on the following day we went back to Durham. I was surprised, moved and grateful. I wish there are words better than “thank you” to say to all the makenew folks. </p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20220409230635.png" alt="Of course without my glasses"></p><p>Plus I bought myself a gift. A newly released LEGO F1 car. I am not a fan of LEGO but a fan of F1. I enjoyed the process of building it. But this is probably the last LEGO I would purchase since it is so expensive haha. But this one is definitely worth it considering the additional value of emotional attachment.</p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image//duke/20220409230708.png" alt="Good luck McLaren :("></p>]]></content>
