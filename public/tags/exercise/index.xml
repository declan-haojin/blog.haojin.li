      <description>&lt;p&gt;On August 28th, I went to a military training base in rural area of my city with my fellow students. Originally, I thought it would be a tough time based on all my past formidable experience with such training. However, I didn&amp;rsquo;t take it anymore during my time in both middle and high school. I took a trip and had computer science classes instead. A fun fact is that I became the whitest among my class after they coming back from training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apart from worry, excitement also haunted around me because it&amp;rsquo;s been a long time to have a training. The result turned out it didn&amp;rsquo;t let me down and I really learned a lot from this fantastic experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;being-a-team-leader&#34; class=&#34;relative group&#34;&gt;Being a team leader &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trying my best to be the team leader is always my style, especially participating in a short-time camp. I frimly deem it&amp;rsquo;s a great opportunity to promote and improve myself. Then I became the leader of group 6 without any hesitate. I deeply know that I am lack of leadership and most important, the decisive personality. This time I failed again on improving that. Everytime I become a leader in a program, unfortunately, I never felt improvement in this field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides that, I believe I did great a great job. Organizing the team, encourging everyone doing high-altitude program and cimmitting myself to everything I can.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
