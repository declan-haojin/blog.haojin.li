      <description>&lt;p&gt;Tenet is an amazing movie with wonderful stories and deep meanings. I am a person never watching a single movie twice, but I did watch Tenet twice. Each time it brought me surprises. It&amp;rsquo;s hard to understand, and I haven&amp;rsquo;t fully understood yet. However, when watching Tenet, it feels like listening to a piece of music with English lyrics. I may not be able to get the meaning of the lyrics the singer sings, but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t affect my mood and enjoyment. The same goes for this movie. I can&amp;rsquo;t figure out how time flows, but I do feel excitement and nervousness following the step of the characters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;destiny&#34; class=&#34;relative group&#34;&gt;Destiny &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not everyone believe in destiny. In this movie, in some way, proves the destiny of each human beings. We all have our faith and mission. Neil probably knew he would die of helping the younger protagonist, he insists to do it without hesitancy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow I&amp;rsquo;ll have a TOEFL test to take and I chose to hang out with my friend and see a movie. All because I was too anxious about the test. I am trying my best to relax and smooth my nerve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Supposedly we were going to see Harry Porter since I never watched the series before and it&amp;rsquo;s a good chance for me to take a look. However, we decided to see the Eight Hundred after all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before watching, I have no knowledge about the movie. I was sitting in the second row in the theater which is my first time to sit so close that I need to raise my head to see the full screen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I heard this movie before. In my concept, everybody has watched this movie in their childhood except me. I have no idea about this cartoon movie at all. It was top100 in Douban and IMDB website which interested me and I want to have a look waiting untill a joyful and lesisure time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;“From now on, I&amp;rsquo;ll drink water so you can drink wine. I&amp;rsquo;ll eat rice so you can eat meat.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The words were said by Simon to his bride Jenifer on his wedding, simple, funny but unforgettable for both Jenifer and audience like me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whole movie is filled with a sad and gauzy atmosphere which is the key point moving me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;my-imagination&#34; class=&#34;relative group&#34;&gt;My imagination &lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be honest, I am dreaming about my future life every second in my mind: What kind of person I will meet, who will I fall in love with, what is waiting for me? Pure and romantic love is important in my fantasy and I believe it&amp;rsquo;s even in most adolescents&amp;rsquo; fantasy. As a 16-year-old man, it makes me shy but full of hope. However, no one will know what will happen in the future. What I can do is keep going with sustainable curiosity and discover my possibility.&lt;/p&gt;
