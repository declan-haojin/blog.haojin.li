&lt;p&gt;While it comes, the application seasion, full of tension, sadness and happiness. At this time, just after finsihing submitting all UC applications, I decided to join this competiton held in Foshan, Guangdong, which is a prosperous city around the Guangzhou. It is a short break for me, for I have some time to reflect the early application season including EA and UC and better think how could I improve in the future. Also, I haven&amp;rsquo;t taken any VEX competition for almost a year due to the COVID. It is the best time for me to catch up with this brand new season and implement my new-learned knowledge in real match.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

      <title>A short trip to Beijing</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This month is really a busy month. Writing essays for application, preparing for TOEFL, learning school courses and participating in Yau Science Awards really stressed me a lot. I feel like I have never been busy as much as now. It&amp;rsquo;s not only about my academic works, since I need to consider many other things that are simple but costs tons of time. All things combined,it&amp;rsquo;s a challenge for me and I need to and have to admit it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;coming-to-beijing&#34; class=&#34;relative group&#34;&gt;Coming to Beijing &lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a week long prepare with my mentor, reviewing my paper and debugging my neural network model, I came to Beijing for semifinal of Yau Science Award(Computer) yesterday. Though I&amp;rsquo;ve been to many places without my parents, I was accompanied with teachers or schoolmates. This trip is truly the first trip that I went alone. To be honest, I even was a little nervous at first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything went OK the first day. Arriving by bullet train, I took 3 subway lines to go to my hotel next to Tsinghua University. The hotel is fine but I booked a room without windows for cheaper price. However, it was really a awful experience that I felt unwell staying at the room. (I swear I would never book a room without room again) So I decided to go to the university for checking the route in advance just in case that I might get lost the next day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be honest, I don&amp;rsquo;t have a good impression of Beijing based on previous visits. No exception, it&amp;rsquo;s the same this time. I don&amp;rsquo;t know if it&amp;rsquo;s a prejudice or something else. Anyway, I don&amp;rsquo;t like this city. It imposes bad feeling to me.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;On August 28th, I went to a military training base in rural area of my city with my fellow students. Originally, I thought it would be a tough time based on all my past formidable experience with such training. However, I didn&amp;rsquo;t take it anymore during my time in both middle and high school. I took a trip and had computer science classes instead. A fun fact is that I became the whitest among my class after they coming back from training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apart from worry, excitement also haunted around me because it&amp;rsquo;s been a long time to have a training. The result turned out it didn&amp;rsquo;t let me down and I really learned a lot from this fantastic experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;being-a-team-leader&#34; class=&#34;relative group&#34;&gt;Being a team leader &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trying my best to be the team leader is always my style, especially participating in a short-time camp. I frimly deem it&amp;rsquo;s a great opportunity to promote and improve myself. Then I became the leader of group 6 without any hesitate. I deeply know that I am lack of leadership and most important, the decisive personality. This time I failed again on improving that. Everytime I become a leader in a program, unfortunately, I never felt improvement in this field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides that, I believe I did great a great job. Organizing the team, encourging everyone doing high-altitude program and cimmitting myself to everything I can.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;难忘的一次经历。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;久别重逢&#34; class=&#34;relative group&#34;&gt;久别重逢 &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;作为刚刚转入国际班的新生，我很荣幸被韩老师选中参加VEX2019世锦赛。赛前，有激动、欣喜，也有紧张与茫然。VEX，于我而言是一个既熟悉又陌生的竞赛项目。初中时在韩老师的带领下参加了“一网打尽”和“星光璀璨”两个赛季，也收获了很多。本以为与VEX在此分道扬镳，没想到如今的久别重逢。与熟悉的金属结构件相遇、与机器人对抗电机高速旋转的齿轮声相遇，更重要的，更重要的是与初中时有着共同热爱与梦想的同学们和老师重逢。这一切都让我激动不已，就像是星星之火在无数个暴风雪夜之后重新成为熊熊烈火一样，照亮了我的心。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;当然，新的问题接踵而至。VEX推出了全新的V5主控套装，新的编程环境，这一切都是需要我去学习和尽快掌握新的知识；这里有了更多陌生的面孔，有身经百战的学姐和学长、还有已经征战将近一个赛季的国一的同学们。而我，作为一个新加入机器人社团大家庭的人，如何让大家认识我、了解我、信任我是亟待解决的问题。&lt;/p&gt;</description>
