I study Computer Science and <span class="block sm:hidden"></span>Political Science at [Duke University](https://duke.edu).

I visited [30 US national parks](/categories/national-parks/) in the past 3 years.

I road-tripped through <span class="block sm:hidden"></span>[11 European countries](/categories/europe-road-trip/) in 20 days.

I swim in freezing water <span class="block sm:hidden"></span>such as a [glacier crevasses in Alaska](https://storage.haojin.li/glacier-swimming.mp4).

I drive people crazy by looping <span class="block sm:hidden"></span>[Take Me Home, Country Roads](https://youtu.be/1vrEljMfXYo/) on repeat.

I enjoy watching Formula 1 and trying out crazy things.
