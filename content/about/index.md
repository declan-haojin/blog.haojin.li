I study [Computer Science](https://www.cs.duke.edu/) and <span class="block sm:hidden"></span>[Political Science](https://polisci.duke.edu/) at [Duke University](https://duke.edu).

I visited [22 US national parks](/categories/national-parks/) in 2 years.

I road-tripped through <span class="block sm:hidden"></span>[11 European countries](/categories/europe-road-trip/) in 20 days.

I swim in any water, <span class="block sm:hidden"></span>even a [glacier crevasses in Alaska](https://a.dropoverapp.com/cloud/download/d81fddba-8c3b-4816-bb27-83fcebb22656/e4f478c7-3ba7-4d90-8a2c-13f863283329).

I drive people crazy by looping <span class="block sm:hidden"></span>[Take Me Home, Country Roads](https://youtu.be/1vrEljMfXYo/) on repeat.

I never met a stranger.
