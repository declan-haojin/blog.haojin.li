I study Computer Science and <span class="block sm:hidden"></span>Political Science at [Duke University](https://duke.edu).

I visited [22 US national parks](/categories/national-parks/) in 2 years.

I road-tripped through <span class="block sm:hidden"></span>[11 European countries](/categories/europe-road-trip/) in 20 days.

I swim in any water, <span class="block sm:hidden"></span>even a [glacier crevasses in Alaska](/media/glacier-swimming.mp4).

I drive people crazy by looping <span class="block sm:hidden"></span>[Take Me Home, Country Roads](https://youtu.be/1vrEljMfXYo/) on repeat.

My friends say I never met a stranger.
