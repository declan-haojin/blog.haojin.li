Spending an hour in Slovakia's capital will captivate your heart.

Indeed, we spent less than two hours in this entire country, and it was an impromptu plan. I realized just last night that this capital of Slovakia is surprisingly situated on the border with Austria and Hungary. This is likely the capital closest to another country in the world. Nevertheless, it's a rather modern city that also boasts a rich historical heritage.

## Blue Church

This is the most beautiful church I've ever seen in my life. Although it's not large by any means, its unique light blue color draws me into a fairytale world when I stand beside it, creating a surreal feeling. It is simply breathtakingly beautiful.

## Old Town Area

We took a brief stroll around the old town district of the city. Although it was quite compact, it exuded a lot of coziness. I noticed numerous senior tour groups navigating the narrow alleys, which was quite a sight to behold. I could easily envision myself enjoying life here in my golden years.

This is likely one of my favourite photos from the trip. It features an elderly man painting the city cathedral, stationed on a median in the middle of the street. Regardless of the bustling traffic around him, he remains solely focused on his painting and the cityscape.

## Bratislava Castle

Regrettably, we didn't have sufficient time to visit the castle and explore its interiors, which I believe is the world's largest. However, even a fleeting view from the bridge was quite satisfying. The castle, with its sanctified and pristine appearance, perfectly encapsulates the vibe of the city.

I would love to visit here seriously in the future. Afterall, I find myself increasingly drawn to small cities and towns, over big metropolises now.
