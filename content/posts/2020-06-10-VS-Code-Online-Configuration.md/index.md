# Before
---

I used to utilize hexo extension `hexo-admin` to write my blog and deploy webpage online. However, it's not very stable with bugs sometimes.

# Now
---

A talented person recommended me to use `code-server` which is a online version of `VScode`. I was struggling with comfiguring it on my server even untill now. On the other hand, it's more stable and convenient for me to use than before, so I am satisfied. Hope I can deploy `Nodejs` on that soon.
