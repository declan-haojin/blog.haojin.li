It's finally time for my le epic Europe road trip.

## Flying to Paris

Finally I am saying goodbye to this sort of lame summer but my summer actually just starts from now. It's still crazy to me that I am going for a 20 day self-driving trip across 10 european countries. The nonstop flight from RDU to Paris was delightful with a decent dinner and breakfast provided by Delta. 8 hours flight and I couldnt sleep because of the excitment. It proves to be the exact excitment I needed.

After arriving at the airport and spending almost 2 hours passing the borader control, I directly headed over to the car rental office. After one of the staff heard my crazy multi country road tripping plan, he instantly said no to my original booked car, a small, manual Fiat 500. He said I would save much more on gas if I would upgrade to a bigger automatic car which I did. It was absolutely right after I got a taste of how bad the Paris traffic was.

## Driving to Palace of Versailles

I've always heard this epic palance somewhere in the France. It appeared in our history textbook, Chinese memes and so on and it was great to actually be able to be physically present in this palace and feel the vibe.

The road in Paris was so narrow and every lane is so narrow compared to the US. However, drivers are really aggressive here with absolutely no courtesy towards other drivers and pedestrians. I was trying to yeild to pedestrains and they stared at me for a while with confusing expression on their face. So I have to not yeild to them which was really weired to me. Other than that, the streets are not clean at all and road signs on the ground was confusing. For some part of the main street, there was not even lines to differentiate lanes.

The most dramatic example would be the big roundabout near Arc de Triomphe. It was so chaoic that I would call it a bumper car field. No lanes, no orders, cars and pedestrians trying to go different directions at the smae time, wanting to go through the same spot. It was funny to me that this happened right in front of this world famous monument of this whole nation.

Anyway, going back to Versailles, it was for sure a beautiful place but not as impressive as I thought.
