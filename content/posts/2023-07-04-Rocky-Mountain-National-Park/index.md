Glasses lost in a beautiful lake, phone fallen from the Rocky Mountain high.

Yes, I lost my glasses and broke my phone in this one park. I kept telling people how happy I was after so many incidents, and I truly meant it. Unlike previous national park adventures, we had much more time to explore this particular park and simply hike within, feeling closer to nature.

## Day 0: Arrival

### Flight Delay

I planned this trip three months ago after returning from Utah National Parks and completely falling in love with national parks. We departed on the Friday night of the July 4th weekend and encountered our first incident when our flight was delayed due to weather. Additionally, my friend's flight from Arizona was cancelled. Fortunately, we all safely arrived at the Denver airport, albeit three hours behind schedule.

The rainstorm was terrible and almost ruined our trip, but it also provided some great views of the sky after it stopped raining, especially during sunset. Looking out from my window, the entire sky turned pink and then transformed into a beautiful golden color when we landed.

### Driving to the park

It seemed like all flights of the day were delayed until late night, so we had a couple of hours to wait to get our rental car. After that, we set off to the beautiful Rocky Mountain National Park around 11pm. The road was tricky with minimal visibility for a while. The fog was so strong that we could not see anything even 10 feet away.

Luckily, we arrived at our Airbnb near the park entrance in Grand Lake around 2 am. It was a small but cozy cabin with a fire pit, which we used every night after that.

## Day 1: Driving through the whole park

### Grand Lake

We set off on our journey after a night of inadequate sleep but excited minds. While stopping by the coffee shop on the way, we had a chance to check out the Grand Lake. It was my first time seeing clouds so close to the lake, and it was quite poetic with the clouds flowing, boats floating, and people talking.

### Alpine Visitor Center & Alpine Ridge Trail

![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image@master/2023/202307091551562.webp)

It is the highest visitor center in the US, with an elevation of 11,796 ft. We had a short hike up to an overlook with a panoramic view of the Rockies. Even though it was only a 20-minute hike, I haven't experienced this kind of reaction to high altitude in a long time. The trail mostly consisted of going uphill, which was quite steep and had mostly stairs. I had to breathe heavily and take multiple breaks due to the high elevation. However, the view was always amazing and definitely worth it.

### Trail Ridge Road

Corresponding to the highest visitor center, the road we were driving on in the park is the highest paved road in the US. We stopped at quite a few turnouts just to appreciate the beauty of the Rockies, the snow, the wildlife, and the sky.

### Gem Lake Trail

This is the first actual hike we did in the park. It is located in Estes Park, which is a town near the east entrance of the park. The town is similar to any other popular tourist town near national parks, with many food options and clothing stores. Driving through the town, we arrived at the Gem Lake trailhead, which was already full for parking. We parked along the road and walked up to the trailhead, which only took a few minutes.

It was a decent hike with characteristics shared by all Rockies hikes: uphill sections followed by downhill sections on the return. I honestly prefer this kind of hike because we tackle the hardest part first, then get to see the rewarding views from the top, and finally return relatively easily.

When we arrived at the lake, I couldn't help but take off my shoes and go into the water. It was not as clear as I had thought, but the view and reflection of the sky and clouds were amazing.

### Kayaking

After the hike, we headed over to explore Estes Park a bit, eating ice creams and buying some souvenirs. We then headed to a lake near Estes Park for kayaking. It was quite funny because we had to wait for a while before getting on the boat due to a heavy thunderstorm. Once we got onboard the boat and started kayaking towards the further end, the weather drastically changed again. I heard the staff on board making those warning sounds and asking us to immediately turn back.

It was a bit disappointing not to have a chance to hit my friend's boat, but it was nice to have a free 10-minute experience before the thunderstorm hit heavily.

## Day 2: Truly amazing lake hikes

### Continental Divide

The weather was still amazing today. We passed through the Continental Divide, which I just learned about in my geology class but have already forgotten. Initially, we stopped by this place to use the restrooms, which are located on both sides of the Continental Divide. We joked that this time we pee in the Atlantic, and next time we pee in the Pacific (which we actually did the following day lol).

### Bierstadt Lake Trail

This was definitely an underrated trail. As mentioned, the elevation gain was brutal when climbing uphill, followed by a flat period, and then we reached the amazing lake. I happened to find out about this lake on AllTrails only because it fit our schedule of around 2 hours. I never thought this randomly picked trail would be so astonishing. On the way up, there were countless overlooks offering unobstructed views of the snow peaks, which we also planned to hike later today.

When we arrived at the lake, it was peaceful, poetic, and simply amazing. There were very few people around, and we sat on a rock, appreciating the tranquility and beauty, despite the abundance of mosquitoes.

We then realized that the trails in this area are all interconnected, which means we can walk a few miles to our next lake destination instead of taking the shuttle bus we had originally planned. So, we switched our trail. Instead of retracing our steps, we decided to walk the lake loop trail and then hike another trail that would lead us directly to the Bear Lake area.

### Bear Lake Trail

It was a pretty easy hike from Bierstadt Lake to Bear Lake, which is the most famous and accessible lake in the park in my knowledge. After seeing the amazing view of Bierstadt lake, the view of Bear lake is overshadowed. It is still an amazing lake view but just not as good as the previous one.

One surprising thing was that we see a deer from only 10 feet away eating in the woods. It was my first time to be this close to a deer and it is beautiful.

### Nymph, Dream, and Emerald Lake Trail

It was quite a strenuous hike because we had already hiked more than 7 miles today. As always, the trail to the lake was all uphill. The elevation of the lake was truly remarkable. The first lake was okay, but the second lake was breathtaking, with a closer view of the snow-covered mountains in the background. And then there was Emerald Lake, which was absolutely sensational. It was situated right next to the snow and beneath the peak, making it irresistible for me to jump in. However, I ended up losing my glasses in the process, and the water was so cold that I could hardly breathe. This reminded me of a previous experience swimming in the sliding rock in Asheville.

When people asked me how it was, I replied, "It wasn't cold at all. But, unfortunately, I lost my glasses." I vaguely remember people laughing at me, but I was too focused on the beauty of the lake and the water. I swam towards the center for a little while, but soon realized I wasn't strong enough to swim across the entire lake. After about five minutes, I swam back, taking the opportunity to simply lie on the lake and appreciate the incredible natural wonders surrounding me. It was an amazing feeling that I will never forget, and it left me longing for more experiences like it in my life.

Emerald Lake is truly amazing, and it was my great pleasure to leave something here in this natural wonder at 14,000 ft.

### Lake Haiyaha

I know I have said that multiple times but Lake Haiyaha is also my favouite lake with a unique turquoise color. And the hike was brutal as well. My firend was too tired to go so I decided to solo hike this 4.4 mile hike. This was my first solo hike and it turned out to be great choice or I would miss this once in a life time lake. Of course, with the helf of my firend's glasses which restored half of my visibility.

![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/declan-haojin/blog-image@master/2023/202307101610548.webp)

I sat on a rock by the lake for a long time because it was simply breathtaking, and I didn't want to leave early. Despite the mosquito bites, I watched as the sunshine played hide and seek behind the clouds, causing the lake to showcase a mesmerizing array of colors, ranging from vibrant turquoise blue to tranquil turquoise.

### Nymph Lake on the way back

And as I made my way back to the parking lot, the sun began to descend and the wind gradually calmed, resulting in a serene stillness on the surface of the lake. By the time I arrived at the first Nymph Lake, which I had previously rated as just okay, it had transformed into something truly breathtaking. The lake now boasted a flawless reflection of the sky, mountains, and trees, creating a scene of utter magnificence.
