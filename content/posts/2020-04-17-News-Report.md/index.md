> He said: "I have always loved information technology-related fields, and I am also a loyal Microsoft fan. In addition to studying in the winter vacation, I self-taught the server construction and maintenance based on the Microsoft Azure cloud service for students free courses. During the learning process, I encountered many difficulties. When I searched the Internet to solve the problem, I often visited foreign open source communities such as Github, Stack Overflow, etc. I saw technical experts answer questions and share their own projects in the community, so I was inspired by this.
