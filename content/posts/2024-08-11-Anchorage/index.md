It's time for another epic road trip.

## Why Alaska?

I don't really have a paticular reason on why I chose Alaska, but I guess it was due to a lot of accidental reasons. Firstly, I was living in Seattle for the summer internship, which is the closest place in the lower 48 states to Alaska. It was only a smooth 3.5h flight. Moreover, I was really moved by the movie Into the Wild, which talks about a guy abandoning everything a society has and decided to go back to the wilderness and live human's nature. I really admire his courage to break all the locks by the society even he eventually died in the wild in Alaska. He and Alaska all represent the highest holiest nature and godness to me.

## Downtown

It was a short drive to the lovely small downtown of Anchorage which has a few good restaurants and souvenior shops. I can tell it was virtually all tourists on the street. While the weather was not good at all, we decided to head towards Kenai Fjords National Park which is around 3 hour south.
