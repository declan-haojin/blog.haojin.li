I heard this movie before. In my concept, everybody has watched this movie in their childhood except me. I have no idea about this cartoon movie at all. It was top100 in Douban and IMDB website which interested me and I want to have a look waiting untill a joyful and lesisure time.



<article class="message is-success is-medium"><div class="message-body">
<i>If You Completely Forget Your Name, You'll Never Find Your Way Home.</i>
</div></article>

I thought it can purify my soul after watching it and everybody highly praised this movie. I begin watching it with high expectation, but honestly, I felt it's a little creepy and so many characters without further plot development. I was disappointed once. 

<article class="message is-success is-medium"><div class="message-body">
<i>Just go back the way you came, you'll be fine. But you have to promise not to look back.</i>
</div></article>

Then, following my regular rountine, I saw some movie reviews on the Internet and I was surprised that they got totally the different feeling from mine. Some critics recognized multiple characters as a projection of people in reality, however I hava no resonance at all. 

<article class="message is-success is-medium"><div class="message-body">
<i>Once you meet someone, you never really forget them. It just takes a while for your memory to come back to you.</i>
</div></article>

It's not the first time that I have distinct opinion about something from that on Internet. I used to add movies which has high ranking on the IMDB while I never do that again now. Everybody has diverse experience, value and judgement, we should not be affected by such conventional thinking but insisting our views on. 

<article class="message is-success is-medium"><div class="message-body">
<i>Something you wouldn’t recognize. It’s called love.</i>
</div></article>

So I believe I have not acquired enough stories, experience enough emotions, see enough people with various personality leading the the fact that I can't feel sympathetic witht the characters in the movie, with the people around me. I hope one day when I rewatched it, I will be able to find something new, something moving, something also existing deep in my heart.
