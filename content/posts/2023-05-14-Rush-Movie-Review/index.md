The best movie about Formula 1 so far that introduces me to a hero.

I haven't enjoyed a movie this much in a long time. I don't know when it started, but my perception of movies has become more skeptical, especially regarding the authenticity of storylines. I suppose after learning so many brutal truths about humanity through anthropology and political science classes, it has naturally become difficult for me to fully immerse myself in any fictional narratives. A few days ago, I went to see Marvel's  *Guardians of the Galaxy 3*, which was supposed to be enjoyable based on its high rating. However, I constantly found myself questioning the authenticity and rationality of the film and its plot development. The character and story development felt too abrupt and unsupported to be believable or emotionally engaging for me. Although I recognize that it's a superhero movie and perhaps shouldn't be scrutinized too closely, the lack of realism made it hard for me to engage. In short, I'm finding it increasingly difficult to enjoy fictional movies.

Yet, this movie has truly been an enjoyable experience for me. But to be fair, it is adapted from not only a true but miraculous story in the history of Formula 1. I have often heard the name Nikki Lauda as a young Formula 1 fan but never had the chance to get to know him. All I knew about him was a vague memory of his death in a race tragedy, which turned out to be untrue. On the contrary, he survived and returned to the grid in just six weeks after suffering severe burns all over his body.

This movie provides a genuine insight into the life of a real, courageous, and talented man with an immense understanding of the race and himself. Many of the details portrayed in the movie, such as the burn damage on his face, I initially thought were merely for dramatic effect, but they turned out to be true. His determination and courage were astounding, racing with blood on his face. I think that from now on, he will be my favorite Formula 1 driver of all time.

As for the movie itself, it is well-developed, and it was heartwarming to see how Niki's character evolved through multiple storylines. He was born with one goal: to win the Formula 1 World Championship. However, he found love and eventually the happiness everyone craves, but at the same time, it proved detrimental to his unwavering dedication to Formula 1. It was particularly sentimental to me when he had all the flashbacks with his wife while racing in the last, yet most important, race of that season. He decided to stop racing due to the great risks involved in the heavy rain at the Japanese Grand Prix. He was strong enough to restart racing after enduring a six-week recovery experience from hell, but he was also strong enough to give up the most crucial race for the love of his wife and his own life. The championship is important, but the moment he felt the love from his wife and realized how she would feel and suffer from another potential serious injury, he backed off. This is the romance of an "ordinary-looking," "fearless" man.

Overall, it is a great movie about a remarkable man in the F1 history.
